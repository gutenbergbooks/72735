<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The stories in this collection were taken down from the lips of over sixty negro story-tellers
in the remote country districts of Jamaica during two visits to the island, one of
six weeks in the summer of 1919, the other of five weeks in the winter of 1921. The
music was all recorded during the second visit by Miss Helen Roberts, either directly
from the story-teller or from a phonographic record which I had made. In this way
the original style of the story-telling, which in some instances mingles story, song
and dance, is as nearly as possible preserved, although much is necessarily lost in
the slow process of dictation. The lively and dramatic action, the change in voice,
even the rapid and elliptical vernacular, can not appear on the printed page. But
the stories are set down without polish or adornment, as nearly as possible as they
were told to me, and hence represent, so far as they go, a true folk art.
</p>
<p>Although some story-tellers claimed to know “more than a hundred” stories, no one
narrator gave me more than thirty, and usually not more than four or five at one interview.
</p>
<p>To all such story-telling, as to riddling and song, the name of “Anansi story” is
applied,—an appellation at least as old as 1816, when Monk Lewis in his journal describes
the classes of “Nancy stories” popular in his day among the negroes as the tragical
witch story and the farcical “neger-trick.” The “neger-trick” harks back to slave
times and is rarely heard to-day; tales of sorcery, too, are heard best from the lips
of older narrators. Modern European fairy tales and animal stories (evidently unknown
to Lewis) have taken their place. Two influences have dominated story-telling in Jamaica,
the first an absorbing interest in the magical effect of song which, at least in the
old witch tales, far surpasses that in the action of the story; the second, the conception
of the spider Anansi as the trickster hero among a group of animal figures. Anansi
is the culture hero of the Gold Coast,—a kind of god—, just as Turtle is of the Slave
coast and Hare (our own Brer Rabbit) of the Bantu people<span class="corr" id="xd32e2638" title="Not in source">.</span> “Anansi stories” regularly form the entertainment during wake-nights, and it is difficult
not to believe that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xii">[<a href="#pb.xii">xii</a>]</span>vividness with which these animal actors take part in the story springs from the idea
that they really represent the dead in the underworld whose spirits have the power,
according to the native belief, of taking animal form. The head-man on a Westmoreland
cattle-pen even assured me that Anansi, once a man, was now leader of the dead in
this land of shades. However this may be, the development of Jamaican obeah or witchcraft
has been along the same two lines of interest. Magic songs are used in <span class="corr" id="xd32e2642" title="Source: cummunicating">communicating</span> with the dead, and the obeah-man who sets a ghost upon an enemy often sends it in
the form of some animal; hence there are animals which must be carefully handled lest
they be something other than they appear.
</p>
<p>Riddling is a favorite pastime of the Jamaica negro. Much is preserved from old African
originals in the personification of common objects of yard and road-side, much is
borrowed also from old English folk riddling. That this spread has been along the
line of a common language is proved by the fact that only a dozen parallels occur
in Mason’s Spanish collection from Porto Rico, at least ten of which are quoted by
Espinosa from New Mexico, while of collections from English-speaking neighbors, fourteen
out of fifty-five riddles collected in South Carolina and nine out of twenty-one from
Andros Island are found also in Jamaica. Particular patterns are set for Jamaica riddling
into which the phrasing falls with a rhythmical swing careless of rhyme,—“My father
has in his yard” and “Going up to town.” The giving of a riddle is regularly preceded
by a formula drawn from old English sources—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Riddle me this, riddle me that,
</p>
<p class="line">Perhaps you can guess this riddle
</p>
<p class="line">And perhaps not!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">generally abbreviated into
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Riddle me riddle,
</p>
<p class="line">Guess me this riddle,
</p>
<p class="line">And perhaps not.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The art is practised as a social amusement, groups forming in which each person in
the circle must propound riddles until his supply is exhausted or his riddle unguessed.
</p>
<p>My own work as a collector in this engrossing field of Jamaican folk-lore owes much
to those collectors who have preceded me and who have enjoyed a longer and more intimate
acquaintance than has been possible for me with the people and their idiom;—to Monk
Lewis, a true folk-lorist, whose “Journal” of 1816 is of the greatest interest to-day,
to Mr. Walter Jekyll and <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiii">[<a href="#pb.xiii">xiii</a>]</span>his excellent volume of songs and stories in the Folk-lore Publications of 1907, and
to the writers of nursery tales, Mrs. Milne-Home, Pamela Smith, and Mrs. W.&nbsp;E. Wilson
(Wona). I take this opportunity also to acknowledge most gratefully the many courtesies
for which I am indebted during my visits to the island. I particularly wish to thank
Professor Frank Cundall for his advice and cooperation, and for the use of the invaluable
West India library connected with the Jamaica Institute in Kingston where I was able
to consult books not easily to be found in library collections. To the Hon. and Mrs.
Coke-Kerr, to Mrs. Harry Farquharson and to the Rev. and Mrs. Ashton I am gratefully
indebted for many courtesies in the task of finding reliable native informants. To
these informants themselves,—to Simeon Falconer, William Forbes, George Parkes, and
a score of others I owe thanks for their ready response to my interest. In America
also I wish to thank Mrs. Elsie Clews Parsons for suggestions as to method and for
the use of her valuable bibliography and Mrs. Louise Dennis Hand for help with Spanish
collections, and to express my grateful obligations to Professor Franz Boas for his
patient editing and valuable bibliographical suggestions.

some big fish put them aside. He said, “Big fish go, make little fish come!” He then
catch the little fish. He say, “Little fish go, make big fish come!” an’ say, “Big
fish go, make little fish come!” He then catch the pot full an’ his hand-basket. He
bile the pot full and sit down and eat it off; he then started home back with the
pot on his head and the basket. Reaching a little way, he hide the pot away in the
bush an take the basket along with him now.
</p>
<p>While going along, he meet up Tiger. Now Tiger is a very rough man an’ Anansi ’fraid
of him. Tiger said to him, “What you have in that basket, sah?”—speak to him very
rough. Anansi speak in a very feeble voice, say, “Nothing, sah! nothing, sah!” So
both of them pass each other, an’ when they went on a little way, Tiger hide in the
bush watching Anansi. Anansi then sit down underneath a tree, open his basket, take
out the fishes one one, and say, “Pretty little yallah-tail this!” an’ put it aside;
he take out a snapper an’ say, “Pretty little snapper this!” an’ put it one side;
he take out a jack-fish an’ say, “Pretty little jack-fish!” an’ put it one side. Tiger
then run up an’ say, “Think you havn’t not’ing in that basket, sah!” Anansi say, “I
jus’ going down to the sea have a bathe, sah, an’ I catch them few ’itte fishes.”
Tiger say, “Give it to me here, sah!”—talk in a very rough manner. An’ Tiger take
it an’ eat them all an’ spit up the bones. Anansi <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>then take up the bones an’ eat them, an’ while eating he grumble an’ say, “But look
me bwoy labor do!” Tiger say, “What you say?” Anansi say, “Fly humbug me face, sah!”
(brushing his face).
</p>
<p>So both of them start to go home now with the empty basket, but this time Anansi was
studying for Tiger. When he reach part of the way, Anansi see a fruit-tree. Anansi
say, “What a pretty fruit-tree!” (looking up in the tree). Tiger say, “Climb it, sah!”
(in a rough manner). So when Anansi go up an’ pull some of the fruit, at that time
Tiger was standing underneath the tree. Anansi look down on Tiger head an’ said, “Look
lice in a Brar Tiger head!” Tiger said, “Come down an’ ketch it, sah!” Anansi come
down an’ said to Tiger he kyan’t ketch it without he lean on the tree. Tiger said,
“Lean on the tree, sah!” The hair on Tiger head is very long. So while Anansi ketchin’
the lice, Tiger fell asleep. Anansi now take the hair an’ lash it round the tree tie
up Tiger on the tree. After he done that he wake up Tiger an’ say that he kyan’t ketch
any more. Tiger in a rough manner say, “Come an’ ketch it, sah!” Anansi say, “I won’t!”
So Anansi run off, Tiger spring after him, an’ fin’ out that his hair is tied on the
tree. So Tiger say, “Come an’ loose me, sah!” Anansi say. “I won’t!” an’ Anansi sing
now,

come an’ give me?” Anansi say, “I will read it for you.” He said, “Hear what it say!
The master say, ‘You mus’ tie Mr. Anansi at the fattest part of the gub-gub peas an’
when the belly full, let him go.’ ” The watchman did so; when Anansi belly full, Anansi
call to the watchman, an’ the watchman let him go.
</p>
<p>After Anansi gone, the master of the peas come an’ ask the watchman what was the matter

<p>There was four friends; one was Anansi, name of the other was Tiger, name of the other

them that the four mus’ change their name an’ when they come home, each one mus’ go
to their mudder house an’ if their mudder call them the old name they mus’ eat their
mudder. So the new name,—Anansi name was Che-che-bun-da, Parrot new name was Green-corn-ero,
Tiger name was Yellow-prissenda, Tacoomah name was Tacoomah-vengeance,—the four new
name. Any mudder call them the ol’ name, they mus’ eat the mudder.
</p>
<p>So they come to Tacoomah house first. Anansi say Tacoomah name ‘Tacoomah-vengeance’.
The mudder didn’t understand the new name, so she say, “Look me pickney Tacoomah come!”
An’ kill Tacoomah mudder an’ eat <span class="corr" id="xd32e3214" title="Source: him">her</span>. Second, ’em go to Tiger mudder. Anansi say Tiger name ‘Yellow-prissenda’. So they

say, “Mudder, if you call me <span class="corr" id="xd32e3219" title="Not in source">‘</span>Anansi’, dey will kill you! but de name ‘Che-che-bun-da’.” The next night they come
to Parrot house. Anansi say Parrot name ‘Green-corn-ero’. Eat Parrot mudder the same.
At night, again Anansi cry excuse an’ go to his mudder, say, “Mudder, las’ night wha’
me tell you say me name?” The mudder say, “Me pickney, you no name Anansi?” Anansi
say, “Ma, coming here tomorrow night an’ if you call me so they <i>kill</i> you! You mus’ call me ‘<i>Che-che-bun-da</i>’!” Ask his mudder again, “Wha’ me tell you say yo’ pickney name?” She say, “Anansi?”

<p>Anansi, Tacoomah and Tiger made a dance; Anansi was the fiddler, Tacoomah the drummer
and Tiger the tambourine man. They travel on till they get to a country where all
the people were naked—no clothing except the head-man, who wore a long shirt; he had
a wooden leg. So they invite up all these people to come to the dance. Mr. Ram-goat
was in the lot. So they start playing and the people start dancing, dance until they
get so tired everybody fell asleep; and Anansi stole the head-man’s shirt—good shirt!—and
put his own old one upon him while he was sleeping.
</p>
<p>The man got awake, miss his shirt. Now this shirt could talk. The man call out, “Long-shirt,
whe’ you deh?” Longshirt answer, “Brar Nansi have me on-o!” They start up, now. Anansi
got so frightened! He met Brar Ram-goat. He said, “Brar Ram-goat, I swap me shirt,
gi’ you one new one fe you ol’ one!” Ram-goat readily make the exchange. The head-man
call out, “Long-shirt, whe’ you deh?” Long-shirt call out, “Bra’ Ram-goat have me
on now-o!”
</p>
<p>Ram-goat run until he was exhausted, couldn’t go any further. He dug a hole an’ bury
himself into the hole leaving one horn outside and didn’t know that horn was projecting
outside. The man with the wooden leg couldn’t go as fast as the rest. All the rest
ran past Ram-goat; the head-man came along, buck the wooden leg upon the horn and
he fell down. When he got up, he thought <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>it was a stump, so he got out his knife to cut off that stump to prevent it throwing
him down again. He cut an’ cut an’ cut till he saw blood. He call out to the rest,
“Look! come now-o, dirtee have blood!” All the rest come around say, “Dig him out!
dig him out! dig him out!” After they dug him out, they took off head-man long shirt,
put on his own old one, and they wet him with all the dirty slops—they drench poor

<p>They thought he was dead and they leave him an’ go away. After they was gone, Ram-goat

<p>Once Mrs. Anansi had a large feed. She planted it with peas. Anansi was so lazy he
would never do any work. He was afraid that they would give him none of the peas,
so he pretended to be sick. After about nine days, he called his wife an’ children
an’ bid them farewell, tell them that he was about to die, an’ he ask them this last
request, that they bury him in the mids’ of the peas-walk, but firs’ they mus’ make
a hole thru the head of the coffin an’ also in the grave so that he could watch the
peas for them while he was lying there. An’ one thing more, he said, he would like
them to put a pot and a little water there at the head of the grave to scare the thieves
away. So he died and was buried.
</p>
<p>All this time he was only pretending to be dead, an’ every night at twelve o’clock
he creep out of the grave, pick a bundle of peas, boil it, and after having a good
meal, go back in the grave to rest. Mistress Anansi was surprised to see all her peas
being stolen. She could catch the thief no-how. One day her eldest son said to her,
“Mother, I bet you it’s my father stealing those peas!” At that Mrs. Anansi got into
a temper, said, “How could you expect your dead father to rob the peas!” Said, “Well,
mother, I soon prove it to you.” He got some tar an’ he painted a stump at the head
of the grave an’ he put a hat on it.
</p>
<p>When Anansi came out to have his feast as usual, he saw this thing standing in the
groun’. He said, “Good-evening, sir!” got no reply. Again he said, “Good-evening,
sir!” an’ still no reply. “If you don’ speak to me I’ll kick you!” He raise his foot
an’ kick the stump an’ the tar held it there like glue. “Let me go, let me go, <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>sir, or I’ll knock you down with my right hand!” That hand stuck fast all the same.
“If you don’ let me go, I’ll hit you with my lef’ hand!” That hand stick fas’ all
the same. An’ he raise his lef’ foot an’ gave the stump a terrible blow. That foot
stuck. Anansi was suspended in air an’ had to remain there till morning. Anansi was
so ashamed that he climb up beneath the rafters an’ there he is to this day.

<p>Anansi an’ Tacoomah while they were frien’s they had a quarrel, so it was an envy
between both of them an’ they never speak. One day Anansi sen’ one of his chil’ over
to Tacoomah’s yard fe some fire. Tacoomah give him the fire an’ some beef-fat. Anansi
see the fat in the chil’ han’, said, “Whe’ yo’ get dat nasty t’ing from?” So the chil’
said, “Brar Tacoomah give it to me.”—“Mak a t’row it away, nasty t’ing!” The chil’
give it to him. He turn away from the chil’ an’ do <i>so</i> (like him fling it away), an’ put it in his mouth; he then out the fire an’ send
back another chil’ fe more fire. She come with the fire an’ some more fat that Tacoomah
give to her. Anansi said, “You carry back that nasty thing come here again? you give
it to me here!” He turn his back an’ did same as he did on first occasion. He himself
now go to Tacoomah yard, said, “Mawning, Brar Tacoomah.” Tacoomah said, “Mawning,
Brar Nansi.” Anansi said, “A wha’ you get all the fat heah from, an’ yo’ won’t tell
me mak me go get some too?” Tacoomah say, “I would tell you, but yo’ so craving you
will go deh an’ go mak trouble.” Anansi said, “Oh, no, Brar! you t’ink if you tell
me wha’ such good t’ings is, me wen’ deh go mak trouble?” Tacoomah say, “All right.
Tomorrow four o’clock, when you hear cow-boy deh drive up cow a ribber-side, you come
wake me an’ you an’ me go.”
</p>
<p>Anansi scarcely sleep fo’ the night, only listening out fo’ cow-boy. While on the
way Tacoomah said to Anansi, “When you go to de cow, you fe say, ‘Open, sesema, open’,
an’ cow will open de belly; an’ when you go in you fe say, ‘Shet, sesema, shet’, an’
then you mus’ cut de fat out of de belly. But you <i>mustn’t</i> cut de back-string, fo’ if you cut it de cow will dead an you can’t get fe come out
again. So after you done cut de fat, you mus say, ’Open, sesema, open’, an cow will
open an’ you come out. You say, ‘Shet, sesema, shet’, an’ de cow will shet.”
</p>
<p>So both of them go down. Anansi go to one cow, an’ Tacoomah go to one use the same
word, “Open, sesema, open!” Anansi go <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>in, say, “Shet, sesema, shet!” an’ the cow shet; an’ then he cut a whole basket of
fat an, after the basket fill he said, “Open, sesema, open!” an’ cow open. He come
out, say, “Shet, sesema, shet!” an’ cow shet. An’ both of them went home.
</p>
<p>The nex’ morning, Anansi, as he hear the cow-boy, never call to Tacoomah at all. He
run down to the river-side an’ go to a fat cow an’ said, “Open, sesema, open!” The
cow open. He go in an’ said, “Shet, sesema, shet!” The cow shet. He begun to cut.
Whilst cutting he cut the back-string. The cow now drop down dead.
</p>
<p>The cow-boy went an’ tell the master an’ he order them to have it cleaned up. Anansi
hide in the <i>ma</i>. The master give his darter the belly to go an’ wash at the river. She carry it in
a bowl, dash it down in the water. Anansi then jump out an’ say to the girl, “Look!
I in the river having a bathe an’ yo’ carry that nasty t’ing come an’ t’row on me!”
The girl begun to fret an’ cry. Anansi say, “You got to carry me to your father mak
him pay me for it!” She then tak Anansi to the father an’ Anansi say will tak a cow
in payment.
</p>
<p>Anansi said he not going to carry the cow come home so to give any of his family any,
so he went into a t’ick wood, kill the cow, mak up a large fire an’ put it in to roast.
He then started to look for ol’ yams in the bush. He saw two eyes in the earth. He
said, “Lawd, from me bwoy bo’n is de firs’ me know say dirtee can hab yeye!” So now
he start to dig out dese yeye,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3545src" href="#xd32e3545">1</a> dig up Bredder Dry-head.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3549src" href="#xd32e3549">2</a> He go fe put him down back in de eart’. Dry-head say, “No, jus’ carry me go where
dat big smoke is yonder!” Anansi refuse to carry him. Dry-head said to him, “If yo’
don’ carry me, de whole of you’ body will catch fire!” Anansi start to run. His whole
body begin to blaze, have to run back an’ tak up Dry-head. On reaching the fire, Dry-head
order Anansi to bring the cow to him. Anansi with a sulky heart got to comply with
Dry-head’, order. Dry-head start eating the cow an’ eat off every bit,—Anansi never
taste it!

<p>Anansi has seven children. He ask them how they would like to name. Six of them like
different name, but one boy say he would <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>like to name “Cunnie-mo’-than father.” So for every tack<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3569src" href="#xd32e3569">1</a> Anansi put up, Cunnie-mo’n-father break it down. One time he work a groun’ very far
away into the bush, an’ in going to that bush he pass a very broad flat rock. So one
day a man give him a yam-plant; that yam name “yam <i>foofoo</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3575src" href="#xd32e3575">2</a> The same day plant the yam, it been bear a very big one same day. So nobody in the
yard know the name of that yam save him, Anansi, alone. So when he go home, he cook
the yam an’ call the wife an’ chil’ren aroun’ to eat, an’ say, “Who know name, nyam;
who no know name, don’ nyam!” So as no one know the name, they didn’t get none of
it; Anansi alone eat off that yam that night. The nex’ day go back to the groun’ and
the yam bear a larger one. He bring it home an’ bile it again, call the wife an’ chil’ren
an’ say, “Who know name, nyam; who no know name, don’ nyam!” The nex’ day he went
back an’ the yam bear a larger one than the previous day. He cut it an’ carry it home,
cook it, call up the wife an chil’ren; he alone eat it.
</p>
<p>Cunnie-mo’n-father say, “Look here! I <i>mus’</i> fin’ out the name of that yam!” He got some okra an’ went to the place where the
broad rock is an’ mash up the okra an’ have the place quite slippery, an’ hide himself
away in the bush near by. Anansi now coming with a larger yam this time. As he reach
to the rock, he make a slide, fa’ down, an’ the yam smash. He said, “Lawd! all me
yam foofoo mash up!” Cunnie-mo’-n-father now catch the name, an’ he ran home now an’
tell mother an’ other chil’ren, “Remember! yam foofoo!” Anansi then take up the pieces,
put them together and carry home. He cook it an’ ca’ all of them roun’ to eat. He
say, “Who know name, nyam; who no know name, no nyam.” They began to guess all sort
of name; after that, whole of them say, “Yam foofoo! yam foofoo!” Anansi get vex,
say, “Huh! eat! nobody fin’ it out but Cunnie-mo’n-father!”
</p>
<p>Anansi then get to hate Cunnie-mo’n-father, want to make an end of him, but he didn’t
know what way was to do it. So one night Brar Tiger came to pay a visit to Anansi
at his house. While both of them sittin’ an’ talkin’, at that time Cunnie-mo’n-father
was lying down underneath the table fawning sleep.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3587src" href="#xd32e3587">3</a> Anansi said to Tiger, “Look heah! ev’ry tack dat I put up, Cunnie-mo’-n-father break
it down. I wan’ to mak an end of him, but I don’ know what way to do it.” That time,
Cunnie-mo’-n-father listen. Tiger <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>said, “I wi’ kill him fo’ you.” Anansi say, “How you will manage it?” So Tiger said
to Anansi, “You mus’ put up a tack, an’ I wi’ ketch him.” Anansi said, “Look heah!
Tomorrow night jus’ at dinner-time you come here hide yo’self in the pepper-tree;
behin’ that fattest limb, you hide yo’self there, an’ I will sen’ him to pick some
pepper an’ as he put his han’ on the pepper-tree, you mus’ hol’ him.” So the nex’
night at dinner-time Tiger went to hide himself there. Anansi call Cunnie-mo’n-father,
say, “Go get pepper from the pepper-tree.” Cunnie-mo’n-father start for de pepper-tree.
On his way going he call in the kitchen an’ take a fire-stick, an’ as he went to the
pepper-tree, he shove the fire-stick right in Tiger face. Tiger cry out, “W’y-ee!”
an’ gallop away. Cunnie-mo’n-father return to Anansi an’ say he hear something in
the pepper-tree cry, so he don’ pick any. Anansi eat his dinner that night without
pepper.
</p>
<p>A few minutes after, Tiger come back in the house an’ tol’ Anansi what have taken
place. Anansi say, “Well, the boy have tack! but we <i>mus’</i> ketch him.” At that time the boy go under the table lay down an’ study for them again.
Tiger say, “How mus’ we ketch him?” Anansi said, “You come here tomorrow twelve o’clock
an’ I’ll sen’ him up on a cocoanut tree an’ while he in the tree, you wait underneath;
when he come down you ketch him.” The nex’ morning, Cunnie-mo’n-father get two bags,
fill it with red ants go up same cocoanut tree an’ hide it, preparing for Tiger. At
twelve o’clock Tiger come to Anansi yard. Anansi call for Cunnie-mo’n-father an’ said,
“Go an’ get me some cocoanuts off’n that tree.” He went, an’ Tiger lay wait under
the tree for him. He shout to Tiger he mus’ look up an’ show him the bes’ cocoanut
he want, an’ while Tiger do that, he open one of the bag an’ throw it down in Tiger
face. Ant begun to bite him an’ he has to run away. Cunnie-mo’n-father slip right
down off the cocoanut tree, so he didn’t get any cocoanut.
</p>
<p>In the evening, Tiger went back to Anansi to tell him how Cunnie-mo’n-father do him
again. While the two of them was talking an’ setting up another tack, Cunnie-mo’n-father
was underneath table listening to them again. Anansi said, “The boy smart! but I goin’
to put you up a tack fo’ ketch him! Look heah! Tomorrow at twelve o’clock, you fin’
yo’self at me groun’ an’ you will see a fat root of yam near to a tree. You mus’ hide
yo’self in the bush an’ I will sen’ him there to come cut yam, an’ as he come there,
hol’ him.” Tiger then went an’ fix himself in the yam bush. At twelve o’clock Anansi
call Cunnie-mo’n-father an’ sen’ him to groun’ to cut yam an’ tell him that very spot
whe’ he is to dig them. <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>Cunnie-mo’n-father went to the groun’ an’ shout out “Yam-o-e-e! yam-o-ee! yam-o-ee!”
t’ree times. Nobody answer. Cunnie-mo’n-father say, “I t’ink father tell me say that
when I come to groun’ call fo’ yam, yam wi’ speak, an’ de yam don’ speak!” Call again,
“Yam-o-ee!” So Tiger answer him, “O-ee-e!” So Cunnie-mo’n-father say, “From me bwoy
born, the firs’ I hear that yam can talk!” So run home back lef’ Tiger.
</p>
<p>So Tiger leave the groun’ an’ come home an’ tell Anansi what happen. Anansi said,
“Well, ’cunnie mo’ than me’ fe trew, but we goin’ to ketch him!” At that time Cunnie-mo’n-father
underneath the table fe listen, an’ unfortunately he fell fas’ asleep. So Anansi an’
Tiger ketch him an’ make a coffin an’ put him in. Anansi tell Tiger he mus’ take him
t’row him far away in the sea where he kyan’t come back again. Tiger lif’ up the coffin,
put it on his head an’ start on the journey. On reaching to a bush he help down the
coffin an’, as the sun was so hot, went underneath a tree an’ fall asleep. Now there
was a little hole in the coffin, an’ looking thru that hole, Cunnie-mo’n-father saw
an ol’ man comin’ along drivin’ a flock of sheep. He began to cry, sayin’ they want
him to go to heaven an’ he don’ ready to go yet. The ol’ man said, “Bwoy, you too
foolish! Heaven’s a good place an’ you don’ ready to go there yet? You open the coffin
put me in!” The ol’ man open the coffin, Cunnie-mo’n-father come out, put in the ol’
man an’ nail up the coffin back with him in it. He then drove the sheep a little way
up inside the bush. Tiger now wake out of his sleep, lif’ up the coffin an’ away he
went to the sea with it, an’ go as far he could an’ t’row the coffin down in the sea
drown the ol’ man, fe’ a heaven he want to go! He then go back to Anansi yard an’
tell him that he has finish with the fellow,—no more of him, fe’ he has drown’ him
in the deepest part of the sea.
</p>
<p>Later in the evening, while Anansi an’ Tiger was sitting down an’ talking about the
badness of Cunnie-mo’n-father, Anansi look an’ see a flock of sheep was coming up
to his house an’ some one driving it. The driver was Cunnie-mo’n-father. Anansi says
to Tiger, “But now look at the bwoy what you drown’ to-day, look at him driving a
flock of sheep coming up!” Tiger said, “No! ’cause I t’row him in the farthest part
of the sea!” They waited until he drove them up to the yard. Tiger said to him, “Boy,
don’t it was you I t’row into the sea to-day?” Cunnie-mo’n-father said, “Yes, the

I would get double more than this!” Anansi, hearing that, said that he would like
to get some himself <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>an’ Cunnie-mo’n-father mus’ carry him an’ t’row him at the part where he can get the
sheep. Cunnie-mo’n-father then get a coffin make an’ put Anansi in it carry him to

that was the las’ of poor Anansi in <i>that</i> story.

</p>
<p>Once the times was very hard. So Anansi had a wife an’ six children dependent on him;
wherever he goes he gets something, so he gets seven plantains, one apiece. His wife
said to him, “Where is yours?” Said ’he mustn’t mind him; when they cook <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>it, each one mus’ give him piece-piece. At the end he got more than anyone ’cause
he got seven pieces.
</p>
<p>He went out another day in search of food and he saw a calabash tree with one calabash
on it, an’ he look at it an’ said, “My! there’s a han’some packey!” The packey say,
“I han’some an’ I can do han’some work.” He said, “Do it let I see!” Packey put a
table before him full of nice eatables; when he eat to his satisfaction, packey shut
up everything.
</p>
<p>He took the packey home with him an’ he shut it up in his loft over-head. Every day
he hide from the family an’ go up there have his good feed an’ whatever little rubbish
he bring in, he give it to them. His wife an’ children watch him an’ fin’ what he
have. After he was gone out, they play the same game—“What a han’some packey!”—“I
han’some an’ can do han’some work.”—“Do it let we see!”—They carelessly let the packey
drop from them an’ crack. When Anansi go home, go to his feed, say, “What a han’some
packey!” packey don’t give him any answer. He find that something was wrong.
</p>
<p>Went out another day an’ saw another packey (which was the same packey), says, “There’s
a han’some packey!” Packey said, “I han’some an’ can do han’some work.” He said, “Do
it let I see!” Packey took out a cow-whip an’ give him a handsome flogging. He t’ought
of having a good joke on the family an’ pick it an’ hung it up in the loft upon the
same place. So the wife an’ chil’ren went to this packey again, expecting the same
thing; so the wife said, “There’s a han’some packey!” Packey said, “I han’some an’
I can do han’some work!” The six chil’ren were around the packey. The wife said, “Do
it let we see!” and the packey out with the cow-whip an’ fall in to lash them right
an’ left. Some tumble down, some get into the shingle hide themselves all around in
the crevice. Jack man dora! That’s the reason why you see Anansi live in the crevice!

<p>Tacoomah and Anansi were great friends. Tacoomah got into trouble. He was tried and
sentenced to be hung. Anansi said, “Brer Tacoomah, no fret! I’m a good liar; I play
you off.” Anansi went to the king to beg for Tacoomah. The king said to him, “If you
give me a puzzle that I can’t answer, I will let him off.”
</p>
<p>Anansi went home. Tacoomah had a mare that was heavy with colt. He said, “Brer Tacoomah,
if you do as I tell you, I can get you off.” Tacoomah said, “Brer Nansi, I will do
anything to save me life!” Go for the mare—the one heavy with colt—open the mare’s
stomach and took out the colt, then took a bit of the mare’s skin and cut out a bridle.
Then Tacoomah got some fresh dirt and filled his hat and put it on, got some silver
and put it into one boot and throw some gold into the other boot. Next, Tacoomah mount
the colt. Anansi said, “Come now, Brer Tacoomah, go now and see king.” He told Tacoomah
all that he was to say to the king when he met him; Anansi put him up to all the talk.
They said to the king:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Under the earth I stood,
</p>
<p class="line">Silver and gold was my tread,

<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first">The king couldn’t guess it; he said, “You must explain to my satisfaction.” And he
said, “I have me hat full of dirt” (took off his hat and show him), “one boot with
silver” (he was standing on silver), “the other boot with gold” (he was standing on
gold also). He rode “a colt that was never born” (he cut that out of the mother’s
belly), and “a bit of the dam” he held in his hand—that was the mare’s skin he had
as a bridle. The king reprimanded him and said, “Go on, me good man, go about your
business!”

</p>
<p>A gentleman had a cowitch<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3780src" href="#xd32e3780">1</a> property. He wanted to have it cut down, but whoever cut it must not scratch their
skin. Anyone who cut it down without scratching, he would give the pick of the best
cow on his property. Many tried, but failed. Anansi says that he will cut it down.
So the gentleman sent his son to watch and see that he cut the tree without scratching
his skin at all. Anansi began cutting and the juice of the tree began to eat him.
He wanted to scratch. He said to the boy, “Young massa, de cow yo’ papa goin’ to gi’
me, white <i>here</i> (scratches one side), black <i>here</i> (scratches the other), had a red <i>here</i>, had anodder black <i>here</i>, blue jus’ down at his feet.” He went on that way until he cut down the tree.
</p>
<p>He got the cow, but he couldn’t manage the removal of the cow alone, and he didn’t
want to get any intelligent person to <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>assist him, he wanted a fool; so he got a man by the name of Foolman. Foolman wasn’t
such a fool as he thought. They removed the cow to a place to butcher it near to Foolman’s
yard, but Anansi did not know that. So he said to Foolman, “Brer Foolman, we mus’
get fire, roast plenty of meat.” Foolman said he didn’t know where to go to get fire.
Anansi pointed out a little smoke a long distance off. Foolman refused to go. He got
vexed and started to go for the fire himself. He was no sooner gone than Foolman called
up his family, butchered the cow, and removed all the parts, leaving the tail. He
dug a hole in the earth and drove the root of the tail down as tight as he could.
When he thought it time for Anansi to come back, he held on to the hair of the cow-tail
and called out, “Brer Nansi, run! Brer Nansi, run!” Anansi come and he say, “Brer
Nansi, de whole cow gone, only tail!” He held on to the tail and both of them thought
to pull up the cow. While pulling, the tail broke in two. So Anansi had to give Foolman
a piece of the tail that popped off. So with all his cunning, he got but a very small
piece.

<p>An old woman had six children, three sons and three daughters. They grew up to be
big men and women. They were living near the roadside. The old woman was sick with
sore eyes, so the children came out by the wayside and began to cry. Hog was passing
by, said to them, “What’s the matter with you, now?”—“Well, Mr. Hog, our mother became
blind and we cannot cure it!”—“I can’t do no good, I can’t cure it!” So Hog went away.
Little <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>after that there was Goat come up. Children were still crying. Goat said, “What’s
the matter with you, now?” Children said, “Well, Mr. Goat, our mother took in with
blindness and we cannot cure it!” Goat say, “I cannot cure it!” and he went on his
way. A little after that Cow came up. “What’s the matter with you, now?”—“Well, Mr.
Cow, our mother took in with blindness an’ we cannot cure it!” Cow say, “I can’t do
no good!” an’ he went on his way. Afterward they heard Jack-ass galloping come along
say, “Hee-haw, hee-haw! What’s the matter with you? what’s the matter with you?” The
children say, “Well, Mr. Jack-ass, our mother took in with blindness an’ we cannot

</p>
<p>Little after that, Anansi come up, hear the children crying, said, “An’ w’at de mattah

cure it!” Anansi said, “I can cure it!” He said, “You know wha’ you all do? Put a
barrel of water in the kitchen, get two barrels of white yam put in the kitchen, a
pound of butter, a pound of lard, ’nuf meat, an’ put dem in de kitchen, an’ I’ll come

when you heah somet’ing say ‘fee-e-e-e’, you all mus’ say, ‘T’ank God, mama have a

</p>
<p>So Anansi kill the ol’ lady, cook off all the yams an’ flour an’ everyt’ing, fry up
the ol’ lady with the butter an’ the lard. He go “fee-e-e-e” an’ the children, hearing

<p>Anansi is accustomed to lie in the sun every morning watching the birds going to feed.
One day he said to White-belly, “Brar White-belly, whe’ you go to feed eb’ry day?
tek me wid you.” So White-belly promised on condition that he would behave himself.
He fitted him out with a pair of wings to fly, and they went to the feeding-trees.
These overhung a river. Every tree White-belly went on, Anansi said, “A fe me tree
dat!” and White-belly went away to another. Anansi eat so much that he fell fast asleep.
White-belly got annoyed. When Anansi was sleeping, he went and took off the false
wings. Anansi turned in his sleep and fell into the river.
</p>
<p>The Fish picked him up and took him to their home. He said, “Cousin Fish, no eat me!”—“If
we are ‘cousin’ we wi’ see!” Fish boiled some hot rice-pop. Anansi said, “It no hot
enough! putee in the sun mekee hot more!” When he thought <span class="corr" id="xd32e4222" title="Source: is">it</span> was quite cooled off, put it to his head, never stopped drinking until it was finished.
Then Fish say, “Yes, me cousin fe trew!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was getting night and Fish told him to remain over until next day. Fish had a barrel
of eggs in the kitchen. Anansi wanted to eat them off, asked Fish to make his bed
in the kitchen for the night. He poached all the eggs in the ashes, left one, and
they went ‘pop!’ The pickney say, “A wha’ stranger man a do deh?” The Fish mother
said, “Have manners, pickney! Let you cousin prosper.” Morning dawn, the mother sent
the children to bring the eggs to her to count them. Anansi said, “Mek the child’ren
keep quiet; me wi’ work!” and he took the one egg, took it to the mother Fish. Each
time she marked it he would wipe it off, take back the same egg, until he had taken
the whole barrel full.
</p>
<p>After that, he said he wanted to go. Fish said to two of the children, “Me son, get
the canoe an’ tek you cousin over the river.” It was looking very breezy and rainy.
When they got half way across, Fish bawled out at the top of her voice, “Bring stranger
man back he-e-ah! fe he eat off all me eggs; only one is heah!” The children say,
“Wha’ ma say?” Anansi said, “You ma say you mus’ row quickly, squall ahead!” The children
rowed across. Anansi took them up, put them in his bag and took them home, eat them.
And from that day, fishes are eaten!

T’ird day come, he burn what he cut, an’ Guinea-hen burn dere too. Ol’ man come in

I kyan’ walk an’ I kyan’ fly, my wing is not strong enough. So, as you have foot an’
wing, you give me one of dem, I’ll go.” Guinea-hen says, “Yes, I’ll lend you my wing
but I kyan’ tak me legs off to give you. See de straight road? You can fly an’ drop,
an’ I’ll run on quick on my feet.” So Fish fly an’ drop, an’ Guinea-hen run on till

<p>There was an old woman, a witch, but she was very wealthy. She lived quite to herself.
Plenty of stock—horses, cows, sheep, mules, each kind kept by itself in a separate
pasture. The old lady’s name was Grandy Beard-o, but nobody knew that name. She wanted
a person to sup with her. She came across a little girl one day. <span class="corr" id="xd32e5412" title="Source: The">Then</span> took that girl home. After she prepared her meal, she called the girl and asked her
if she knew her name. The girl said, “No, ma’am.” She said to the girl, “Unless you
tell me my name, I will not give you anything to eat.”
</p>
<p>She started out the girl to go and fetch some water. The girl had to go through all
the pastures to get where the water was—mules to themselves, cows to themselves, horses
to themselves, sheep to themselves. She went along crying, being hungry. So she got
into cow-pasture—that was first pasture. The cow said to her, “What’s the matter with
you, me baby?”
</p>
<p>The girl said, “The old lady will not give me anything to eat except me can tell her
her name!” Cow was afraid to tell her.
</p>
<p>From there she went into mule pasture, crying all the same. Mule said, “What’s the
matter, me baby?”
</p>
<p>The girl said, “The old lady will not give me anything to eat, except me can tell
her her name!” Mule wouldn’t tell her.
</p>
<p>She got into horse pasture, crying all the way. Horse said, “What’s the matter, me
baby?”
</p>
<p>“Old lady in there won’t give me anything to eat except me can tell her her name!”
Horse wouldn’t tell her.
</p>
<p>From there she went into bull pasture, still crying. Bull said, “What’s the matter,
me baby?”
</p>
<p>“Old lady won’t give me anything to eat except me can tell her her name!”
</p>
<p>Bull says, “Cho! when you go home, tell her her name Grandy Beard-o.” Bull was a mighty
man; he didn’t care!
</p>
<p>The girl was so glad, hastened home so as to get something to eat. Old lady said,
“You can tell me my name make me give you something to eat?”
</p>
<p>The girl said, “Your name Grandy Beard-o, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>Old lady got so indignant! She gave the girl a good feed and after that she started
to find who told the girl. Went into cow pasture.

<p class="first">The old lady gripped the bull and tossed him in the air. The bull dropped; nothing
happened. The bull tossed her in the air now, and she dropped; one leg broken. She
tossed the bull again; the bull came down unhurt. The bull tossed her up again; she
came down, another leg was broken.
</p>
<p>She tossed the bull; nothing happened. The bull tossed her; she came down, one arm
broken. She tossed the bull again; the bull came down unhurt. The bull tossed her
again; she came down, the other arm was broken.
</p>
<p>She tossed the bull again; the bull came down unhurt. The last toss the bull made,
her neck broke. That was the end of her. The girl became mistress of all she possessed,
and that is why the land goes from hand to hand in legacy up to to-day.

home he locked up Miss Nancy till he came back. He did not come back that day, and
as Miss Nancy was hungry and saw a sheep passing she said, “Do, my dear sheep, call
Contavio for me and I will throw a lump of gold on your head.” Bra Sheep goes, “Bep,
baah baah baah.” She said, “No, my dear Bra Sheep, that will not do.” Soon after she
saw a billy-goat and said the same thing to him. Bra Billy said, “Bep, bep, ba, ba,
ba, bep-ba-ba-bep, bah, bah.” She said, “No, my dear Bra Billy, that will not do.”
She then saw Bra Peacock coming up an’ she said, “Bra Peacock, if you call Contavio,
my husband, for me, I will give you a lump of gold,” and Bra Peacock flew right away
until he saw Contavio, and he picked him in his head and picked off all the feathers,
and spurred him the whole way home until all Bra Peacock’s spurs dropped off. When
he got Contavio home, Miss Nancy flung the lump of gold on Bra Peacock’s head and
that’s why the feathers on a peacock’s head look like gold. That’s also the reason
why it has no spurs, and a crow has no feathers on its head.

<p>A woman have a daughter, oftentimes engaged and wouldn’t marry, said that the gentlemen

was an Old Witch, told her that man was a snake. She said the man was too well-dressed
to be a snake, but the brother was going home with them under the carriage as a lizard.
The first place, as he was going on, somebody ask, “Mr. Snake, I beg you give me my
collar,” and the next, “Mr. Snake, I beg you give me my jacket,” and so on until he
show himself plain as a snake.
</p>
<p>When they get home, he lock her up wanting to kill her, but couldn’t kill her without
the thing called “bump.” Go out in the yard looking for it. After them gone, the mother-in-law
said, “Me daughter, dis man you marry going to kill you because he is a bad man and
he marry a wife already and kill her and he gwine to kill you too. I would let you
go, but him have one cock, him so chat!” So she threw a barrel of wheat an’ a barrel

<p class="first">Then Snake come from the wood while the brother was taking her on the water. Snake
overtake her, take her home again and lock her in, go back in the wood again in search

<p>There was a bird Arinto; it used to feed on human flesh. In the district there was
a little boy by the name of David Lawrence who was lame in both feet. When the boy
heard the bird fly, he asked his sister to take him; but she refused, saying if she
remained Arinto would eat her too. The boy, having no other resource, dug a hole in
the ground where he lived for some time. When the bird came and perched on the house-top,
he said, “Smell flesh; somebody about here!” Then David Lawrence sang,

<p>Then the bird pitched off the house to the spot where he heard the singing. As it
was an underground passage, the boy would move along and the bird would follow him
up and down. As he went to the foot (of the passage), the bird would go there; as
he went above, the bird would go there,—all day like that. At night the bird would
go to rest,—couldn’t eat he was so tired. But the boy cooked at night and had his
rest.
</p>
<p>It went on for some weeks until the bird got tired an’ weary and one night fell off
the roost. David Lawrence came out, cut out the tongue, and took it to the king, who
had promised whoever killed Arinto would get his daughter’s hand in marriage. Anansi,
passing the nex’ day, saw the dead bird, cut off the head and hurried with it to the
king. A wedding feast was made to have Anansi married to (the king’s) daughter. Just
as that was going on, a ragged boy called at the gate, but Anansi told the king to
have nothing to do with him. But he appealed so loudly that the king after all went
out, and the boy said to him, “Anansi <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>is a usurper, because, king, have you ever seen a head without a tongue?” Anansi,
on hearing that, ran under the table and from there into the house-top. David Lawrence
was taken in, dressed, married to the king’s daughter, and lived happily.

</p>
<p>Once upon a time a woman had one daughter, an’ that daughter was the prettiest girl
in an’ around that country. Every man want the girl to marry, but the mother refuse
them as they come. Tiger, too, wanted the girl, an’ demands the girl, an’ the mother
says no. Tiger said if he don’t get the girl he will kill her. So they remove from
that part of the country and go to another part, into a thick wild wood where no one
live. And she made a house with a hundred doors and a hundred windows and a large
staircase; and the house is an upstairs, an’ there both of them live.
</p>
<p>Tiger hear of it, always loafing aroun’ the house to see if he can catch the girl,
but the girl never come out. During the day, the mother went to her work, leaving
the girl at home. When going out, the mother fasten all the doors an’ windows; coming
home in the evening, at a certain spot where she can see the house an’ notice that
all the windows an’ doors are close as she leave it, then now she have a song to sing,
go like this,—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Tom Jones, Tom Jones, Tom Jones!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">(that’s the name of the girl). Girl now—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Deh lo, madame!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Woman said to her now,

<p class="first">The door don’t open without that song now, and when it open, the mamma go into the
house.
</p>
<p>At that time, Tiger in the bush listening to the song. So one day while she was away,
hear time for her to come home, Tiger approach the spot where she always sing. He
now in a very coarse voice sings the song,—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Tom Jones, Tom Jones, Tom Jones!”</p>

<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first">The girl look from the window, said, “Tiger, a who no know sa’ a you!” So now Tiger
go ’way an’ hide till mamma come. When she come, he listen good. Next day, Tiger go
to a blacksmith an’ ask de blacksmith what he t’ink can give him, Tiger, a clear v’ice.
De blacksmit’ say he must hot a long iron an’ when it hot, mus’ take it push down
his t’roat. An’ de blacksmit’ give him a bit of meat to eat after he burn the throat
an’ that will give him a clear v’ice. So Tiger go away eat de meat first an’ den burn
de t’roat after. Nex’ day he went to the spot where the woman always sing from. An’
that make his v’ice more coarser. He sing now—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The girl look thru the window an’ say, “Cho! a who no know sa’ a you!” So Tiger got
vex’ now, an’ he went home, burn the throat first and afterward eat the meat, and
that give him a clearer v’ice than the woman. The nex’ day, when most time for the
woman to come home from her work, Tiger went to the spot where he can see the house.
He begin to sing,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Tom Jones, Tom Jones, Tom Jones!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The girl answer (tho’t it was her mother now)—

</div>
<p class="first">Then Tiger say,
</p>

<p class="line">Fare you well, me dear; fare you well, me love!

<p class="first">And as the door open, Tiger step up an’ caught the girl an’ swallow her.
</p>
<p>And when the mother coming home, reach to the spot and saw the doors and windows open,
she throw down what she carry and run to the house. And she saw Tiger lay down. And
the mother then went away an’ get some strong men come an’ tie Tiger, kill him, an’
open de belly an’ take out de daughter. At that time, little life left in her an’
they get back the life in her. The woman then leave the house an’ go off away far
into another country, and that is why you always fin’ lot of old houses unoccupied

pretty baby. She was so glad she took it home and she made a pet of it. She employed
a girl called Tamanty to care for the child, and Anansi to be the watchman to watch
and see if the girl cared for the child.

Anansi wanted all along to get rid of this girl Tamanty. Tamanty was sweeping the
house and the little child was playing with the broom. Anansi winked to the girl and
said, “Lick him wi’ the broomstick! lick him wi’ the broomstick!” The girl took the
broomstick and hit the child. The child started running for the river. Anansi and

<p>Ali Baba was the brother of Kissem, but Ali Baba was a poor man and Kissem was a rich
man. Ali Baba had two donkeys and an ox,—all his living. Ali Baba was cutting wood
one day, he heard a company of horse coming afar. Took his donkeys and hid them in
the bush, hid himself in a tree. Forty men were coming on; the head man came right
to the cave where he was. Name of the cave was “Sesame.” This cave was shut, would
open by the word “Open, Sesame.” And they brought forty bags of gold an’ put in. Shut
without word. Ali Baba saw them from the tree-top. When gone, Ali Baba came down to
the cave, said, “Open, Sesame, open!” Ali Baba took all the money he could, loaded
it on the donkey.
</p>
<p>Must measure the money, but didn’t have any measure. Brother said, “What Ali Baba
got to measure?” Took stuck the measure. Ali Baba measure, measure, measure, measure
thousands of dollars. One piece stuck on the bottom. Brother aska; Ali Baba tells
all about it, teaches brother, “Open, Sesame, open.” Next day, Kissem took wagon,
oxen, servants, went to the place, said, “Open, Sesame, open!”. When he went inside,
cave shut. When he went on, saw all the money, he forgot the word, said, “Open, kem!
Open, wem! Open, rim! Open, sim!” Forgot that word entirely, can’t get out. The men
came back; “Open, Sesame, open!” Find Kissem. “How came you here?” No answer. Cut
Kissem up in five pieces, hung them up in the cave.
</p>
<p>Kissem’s wife went to Ali Baba, said, “Kissem no come here yet!” Ali Baba went next
day to the place. “Open, Sesame, open!” Finds the five pieces, takes them down, gets
a cobbler to sew the five pieces up into a body. Robber comes back, finds body gone.
Who took away that body, signifies some one knows the place; must find out who that
is. Goes about town, finds a cobbler <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>who said he joined five pieces into a body. Cobbler shows the house. He gets jars,
puts a robber in each jar; one jar has oil. Takes the jars to Ali Baba, says will
he buy oil. Ali Baba says yes.
</p>
<p>He makes sport for the great governor. Ali Baba had a maid by the name of Margiana,
and she was very wittified,—discovered the whole thing, but she didn’t say anything.
She danced so well, danced up to the governor to give her something. He put his hand
in his pocket to get her something; Margiana get one dagger, killed the governor dead.
Margiana got the oil red-hot, poured into all the jars that got men. Ali Baba said,
“Well, Margiana, you saved my life and you shall have my son and as much money as
you want, and as much money as will put you in heaven!”

<p>Once Cinderella and her godmother lived together, and godmother told her there was
a certain room in the house that she wasn’t to enter at all. One day while godmother
was out, Cinderella said she must see what was in that room. After going there, she
was extra frightened to meet up a large pot boiling with blood and no fire underneath.
When godmother came back, she found out that Cinderella had gone into the room. Calling
her to her, she told her that she must tell her the truth now; when <span class="corr" id="xd32e7532" title="Source: se">she</span> went into the seventh chamber, what did she see? Cinderella replied, “Dear Godmother,
I saw nothing and nothing shall I talk until my dying day!” She asked her the same
question again, and Cinderella repeated the same answer. Then she was so annoyed that
she took Cinderella into a deep wood about ten miles away and asked again, “Cinderella,
when you went into the seventh chamber, what did you see?” The girl again repeated,
“Dear Godmother, I saw nothing and nothing shall I talk until my dying day!” The godmother
threatened to cut out her tongue if she <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>wouldn’t tell her the truth, but she kept saying the same as before, so then the godmother
was so annoyed she cut out her tongue and left her there weeping extra.
</p>
<p>Well, after a day passed, there was a king travelling through the woods and he saw
this lovely little girl. And she was stripped naked and still weeping. The king asked
her what she was doing there and she couldn’t tell at all, only cry. And the king
took his silk handkerchief, wrapped her up and took her home with him. Some time after,
the girl had a boy child for the king. The godmother heard of it all right, and when
the ninth night came, godmother came in and stole away the baby and put a cat in the
bed. When the king got up and saw the cat, and asked what she had done with the baby,
she couldn’t tell, only weep all the time. Some time after, she had a girl baby. When
the nine nights went round again, the goddie went to the bed, took the baby and put
a big block of rotten wood in the bed. And the king was again amazed, asked her what
she had done with his baby and she couldn’t tell, only cry. Well, the king threatened
to imprison her for his two babies, but seeing her so fretful and pitiful, he gave
her a chance. Some time after, she had a boy baby again. After the nine days came
round again, they put up soldiers to keep guard in the room and all outside and round
about the yard, and at the gate soldiers with guns and bayonets. And godmother came
in and took away the baby and plastered up the mother’s mouth and everywhere in the
bed with blood. So when the morning awoke now, the king believed that the girl had
been eating all his babies, and he advertised around the country that she was to be
hung on such a day.
</p>
<p>Well, after the day came around, all the high men gathered at the place to see her
hung. After the sentence was passed and she was about to receive her death, some one
called to them they must stop because some nobleman was coming. And they spied afar
off one of the most beautifulest carriages glittering in the sun. So they waited until
the carriage came, and it was that old godmother with the three children grown to
a big size. And she came in and put the two boys on the king’s leg and the girl in
the middle, and put in the girl’s tongue, and she was able to talk for herself now.
Also, the godmother got a good sum of money from the king for the good care she had
taken of the three children; and instead of sorrow, they had a merry day. And the
king went home and married the girl and they lived very happily after that.

<p>I’ll give you a plain story that you may be able to write it down and the words may
not puzzle you to spell,—all plain words.
</p>
<p>There was a lady and her maid lived in a palace upon a very high mountain. There was
nobody allowed to go up the mountain except a fisherman alone. The maid had a baby
who was her first son. A couple of days after, her mistress had a baby who was her
first son. Next morning the fisherman came up and saw the two babies. The fisherman
owned the two children as his sons. The fisherman broke a limb from a rose and stuck
it in the ground as a plant. Immediately it grew a tree with a beautiful shade. Under
the tree he placed a golden table, for his two sons to play their billiard under.
Day by day they went under the tree and played their billiard there.
</p>
<p>The first son’s name was Adam; the second son, his name was Bob. One morning early
Adam said to Bob, “I am going to-day to see what the world is like.” He called for
his mare and a cane-stick and a hound, and he mounted his mare and he started away.
He rode that day long, till night came down. He saw beautiful light on the top of
a hill. He went up to the house. A lady met him at the door. The lady asked him where
he is going. “I am travelling to see what the world is like.” The lady said to him,
“You best to remain here with me, for ten young men have passed this same way and
never returned again.” The first one came, and she gave him one hundred keys to open
ninety-nine doors, but never open the hundred. The first door that he opened he saw
beautiful things, until he opened ninety-nine and every one he saw better things.
He was forbid not to open the hundred, but he would like to see what (was) inside
the hundred and he opened the hundred and he saw (a) beautiful green pasture with
a coal-black horse standing there full-rigged with saddle and bridle, and there he
mounted on. And the horse made one rear and he dropped into a palace and there he
saw ten young men sitting upon ten chairs. There were two chairs left, nobody thereon.
He sat upon one. The eleven men that were sitting on the eleven chairs now, all had
one eye.
</p>
<p>Bob, his brother, who (was left) at home, next morning broke a branch from the tree
and threw it on the ground, and it withered at once. “Mischief befalls me brother!”
He called for his mare, he took his cane-stick, he called for his hound, he mounted
his <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>mare. He said to his mother, “My brother is dead; wherever he is, I must find him
to-day.”
</p>
<p>He rode for that day till it was night. He saw the light on the hill. He went up the
hill. The same lady met him at the door. She asked him where he was going. “I am going
to look for my brother Adam.” The lady said to him, “Eleven came here before and have
gone the same way and never returned again; there is one chair left and you will sit
thereon!” She gave him one hundred keys to open ninety-nine doors, and forbid him
not to open the hundred. The first door he opened he saw beautiful things, and he
opened ninety-nine doors. The one key was left. “It is just as well for me to open
the hundred!” And he saw the same black horse, the handsomest animal in the world,
with saddle and bridle thereon. He mounted the horse, and he reared and dropped in
the same palace where his brother was. There was a chair provided there for him, and
(he) found that he had only one eye the same as the other eleven had. If he had heard
what the lady had said, he wouldn’t have gone to look for his brother who was lost.

</p>
<p>Jack was a great gambler,—no one could ever beat him a game; and he went and gambled
with the Devil Errant. Jack won the first, second and third games; the Devil Errant
won the fourth and the fifth games. The Devil Errant said to Jack, “I require nothing
of you but to find me in three months.” No man knew where the Devil Errant lived,
and if Jack doesn’t find him in three months, the Devil Errant will take his head.
And the Devil Errant knew where Jack lived.
</p>
<p>Jack was fretting and didn’t know what to do. He asked every one of his friends and
they said they didn’t know the Devil Errant and didn’t know where he lived. He went
to the keeper of the world and asked him where the Devil Errant lived. He said, “How
could you play cards with a man like that! However, I am <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>keeper of all the beasts. In the morning I will ring the bell and all will come and
I will ask them if they know the Devil Errant.” In the morning he rang the bell and
all the beasts came. Everyone said he didn’t know the Devil Errant. So he said, “I
don’t know what to do, Jack; but I have a brother who lives three hundred miles from
here, and I will roll a barrel and you must go after the barrel; where the barrel
stops, that will be where my brother lives.”
</p>
<p>In the morning, he rolled the barrel and Jack followed the barrel, and it stopped
in the brother’s yard and Jack stopped too. And he asked the brother if he knew the
Devil Errant and he said no, didn’t know a man like that. And he said, “Well, I am
the keeper of all the fish in the sea. In the morning I will ring the bell and all
the fish can come <span class="corr" id="xd32e7607" title="Source: und">and</span> I will ask them if they know the Devil Errant.” In the morning, he rang the bell
and all the fish came and they said they didn’t know a man like the Devil Errant.
</p>
<p>Jack was fretting, for it only needed three days and the three month would be gone.
The brother said, “Well, I don’t know what to do, but I have another brother who lives
two hundred miles from here. Tomorrow I will roll the barrel and where that barrel
stops that will be the place.<span class="corr" id="xd32e7612" title="Not in source">”</span> In the morning, he rolled the barrel and Jack followed after the barrel, and when
he got to the other brother the brother said, “Well, I don’t know such a man by the
name of the Devil Errant, but I am the keeper of all the birds in the year, and in
the morning I will ring the bell and they will come and I will ask them if they know
the Devil Errant.” In the morning, he rang the bell and all the birds came <span class="corr" id="xd32e7614" title="Source: exept">except</span> one named the Quack, and everyone said he didn’t know the Devil Errant. Little after,
the Quack came up. The keeper asked him why he didn’t come all this time and he said,
“I was just at the Devil Errant’s yard picking up a few grains of corn.” The keeper
said to Jack, “This is the only one who can take you to the Devil Errant’s yard.”
</p>
<p>Jack had to kill a cow now and cut it up in pieces and put it on the bird’s back along
with himself, and every time the bird said “Quack,” give him a piece of meat. The
Quack was a greedy bird; said “Quack” and gave him a piece, “Quack” and gave him a
piece, “Quack” and gave him a piece, “Quack” and gave him a piece, till he gave him
the whole cow, didn’t have any more to give him. The bird said “Quack” and he gave
him his hat, “Quack” and he gave him his boots, “Quack” and didn’t have anything more
to give him, and the bird dropped him at the river-side.
</p>
<p>As Jack was there crying he saw an old man come. The man <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>said, “Jack, what you doing here?” Jack said, “I was gambling with the Devil Errant
and he won me the fourth and fifth times and he said I was to find him in three months,
and the three months are up to-day.” The man said, “Well, I advise you to stay here
for a few minutes and you will see the Devil Errant’s two daughters come to bathe.
You must not trouble those two, but when you see the third one come, when she goes
to bathe take her clothes and hide them, and when she comes out to look for the clothing
say to her, ‘Your father played me a trick and I will play you one too!’ ”
</p>
<p>Jack did so. When the girl looked for her clothes, Jack said, “Your father played
me a trick and I will play you one too.” And the girl fell in love with Jack and told
him all her father’s secrets and said, “Now, Jack, when you go to my father’s gate,
if he tells you to come in you mustn’t go in at the gate; for there will be a sword
ready to cut off your head. Let him come and open the gate for you.” So when Jack
went to the Devil Errant’s yard, the Devil Errant said, “You are very clever indeed,
Jack! Open the gate and come in.” Jack said, “No, you come and open it.” The Devil
came and opened the gate.
</p>
<p>The Devil said, “As you are so clever to find me in three months. I will give you
another task to do.” He dropped his gold ring into an empty well and said, “Go and
pick it up.” When Jack went, the well was full of water. Poor Jack was hungry and
crying. He saw the girl coming with his breakfast and a bag with a machete in it.
And she said, “Why are you crying, Jack?” He said, “Because your father has given
me a task I can’t do.” She said, “What is it?” He said, “He dropped his ring into
the well when it was empty, and when I went to pick it up, it was full of water.”
She said, “Well, what you must do is to take this machete now and cut me up in pieces
and I will be a ladder, and when you are coming back, you must take up every piece
and put it into this bag and I will become the same woman.<span class="corr" id="xd32e7625" title="Not in source">”</span> Jack said he couldn’t do it at all, but she forced him to and so he did it. He chopped
her up and put her down and she became a ladder, and every time in coming up he took
up a piece until he had taken up the whole, only one little piece he forgot, till
at last she became the same woman, only she had lost one of her finger-joints; but
she said, “Never mind for that, Jack!”
</p>
<p>Jack took the ring to the Devil Errant and he said, “Since you are so clever, I will
give you another task; take this house, now, and shingle it with dove feather.” Jack
was crying and he saw <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>the girl coming with a barrel of corn. She said, “Now, Jack, dash this corn about
the house and every bird will come to feed; and pick the feathers and shingle it with
dove feathers.” And so Jack did.
</p>
<p>And the Devil said, “You are so clever I will give you another task to do, and when
you have done that I will set you free.” And he gave him a bit and said, “Go and catch
my horse in the pasture.” When Jack went to the pasture he saw it was a mountain of
sea. Jack was crying and he saw the girl coming with a gun and a stone. She said,
“Don’t cry, Jack! take the bridle and stone, fire the gun and dash into the sea. The
horse will come and put his head into the bit, as my grandfather was buried here.”
</p>
<p>When Jack carried the horse to the Devil Errant, the Devil Errant said, “You are very
clever indeed. I will give you one of my daughters to marry.” He had the three girls
dress alike and gave a grand dance and said when they were dancing he must pick out
the one that he loved the best. The girl told him that she would wear a different
branch and told him what branch she would wear, so he picked out the youngest daughter.
The Devil Errant said he couldn’t give him that one at all because she was too young,
but Jack said she was the only one he loved, and the Devil Errant couldn’t break his
promise and had to give her to him, and they got the parson to come and marry them.
</p>
<p>That night the wife said, “Well, Jack, father is going to kill you tonight.” When
they went to bed, the wife made two wooden babies that would cry and put them in the
bed; and they went into the pasture and got the best riding horses her father had
and started for home. The devil got a pot of boiling water and threw it <span class="corr" id="xd32e7636" title="Source: trough">through</span> the <span class="corr" id="xd32e7639" title="Source: chimmey">chimney</span> into the room on the bed. When he heard the babies cry, he went to cut their throats
and he found the two wooden babies. So he went after them. The horse’s name was “Supple
Jack.” The girl said to Jack, “Look, look behind you and see what you see!” Jack said,
“Your father is at the horse’s tail!” She said, “Take this grain of corn and throw
it and it will turn a wood of trees that he can’t pass.” The Devil went back for his
axe, and felled the wood. She said, “Look, look behind you, Jack, and see what you
see!” He said, “Your father is at the horses tail!” She said, “Take this sweat and
drop it behind you and it will mount to a great river he can’t cross.” The devil went
back for his ladle and ladled the water till he drowned; he couldn’t go any further!
</p>
<p>The girl said to Jack, “As you have been away so long, don’t take me with you; leave
me at the lodgings and come back to-morrow <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>for me. But you must not kiss anyone; if you kiss anyone, you will forget me and never
remember me any more.” So Jack went home. His mother and sisters and everybody came
to kiss him, but he refused to kiss them. He lay on the sofa sleeping and a pet dog
came and kissed him, and Jack never remembered his wife any more for four years. Then
they made a great entertainment. Jack was just about to marry the next day to another
woman, and he and his bride went to the entertainment. The first wife sat down at
the window sad. They asked her to go with them to the entertainment. She said no,
she was not going, but they forced her to go with them. As everybody was enjoying
himself, they asked her to entertain them. She knocked her left side; a rooster came
out. She knocked her right side; a hen came out. She knocked her stomach; a grain
of corn came out. The rooster took it away from the hen. The hen said, “Get away,
you ungrateful rooster! You came into my father’s yard, he gave you a task to do and
you couldn’t do it. He dropped his gold ring into the well and you couldn’t take it
out, had to mince me in pieces, and now I have lost one of my little finger joints!”
She knocked again and another grain of corn came out. The rooster took it away from
the hen. The hen said, “Stop, you ungrateful rooster! You came to my father’s yard,
he gave you a task to shingle a house with dove feathers and you couldn’t do it; I
had to do it for you!”
</p>
<p>Jack said, “I remember something!”
</p>
<p>She knocked on her stomach again and another grain of corn came out. The rooster ate
it up. She said, “Get away, you ungrateful rooster you! You came to my father’s yard.
He gave you his bridle to go and catch his horse and you couldn’t catch it and I had
to show you how to do it!”
</p>
<p>Jack said, “I just remember my fault!” Jack fell down at her feet and begged her to
forgive him. He said to the company that a man had lost a key and was about to buy
a new one when he found the old one just as good, and everybody told him there was
now no occasion to buy the new one. Jack said, “Well, this is my wife that I forgot
for four years, and I have found her!” He put her in his buggy and drove home and
left the other one in the same place. And they both lived happy forever.

<p>Once Jack’s wife gave him a cow to sell, and she told him the cow cost twenty pounds.
Three men bet they could get the <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>cow cheap. They hid at different places along the wayside, and one came out and asked
Jack if he was selling that goat. Jack said, “No, me man, it’s a cow, not a goat!
because me wife told me it’s a cow and I can’t sell it for a goat.” The man told Jack
his wife was making a fool of him and he would give him a dollar for the goat, but
Jack refused. After he had gone for a couple of miles, a second man came out and repeated
to him all that the first had said. And Jack refused to sell the cow and went on.
After a couple of miles again, the third man came out and said he must sell him the
goat. Jack got angry himself now, and the man offered him three dollars and he took
it and returned to his wife with it and told her all that had happened to him with
this goat she gave him for a cow. The wife was angry and told him she would have nothing
more to do with him until she got her twenty pounds for the cow.
</p>
<p>Jack took the three dollars and started off in a deep study. He went to a shop and
called for a bottle of whiskey, which cost a dollar. After paying for it, Jack asked
the man to let it remain until he returned back, and the clerk consented. He went
to a second shop and bought a bottle of whiskey for a dollar and asked the clerk to
put it up also till he returned. He went to a third shop, bought a bottle of whiskey
also and asked the clerk to let it remain. After going about three miles, he met up
with the three men who robbed him out of his wife’s cow and says to them would they
mind going to the shop and taking a drink with him; and they said yes. At the shop,
Jack called for a bottle of whiskey, the four of them served it in glasses and drunk
it all. Jack took off his hat and clapped it on the counter and said, “It’s well paid
for!” and the clerk said, “All right, Jack, we know that.” After they go outside,
the three men want to know how Jack didn’t pay for the whiskey and yet the clerk believe
that he paid for it. Jack said as long as he clapped his hat on the counter, they
must say that he paid for it. They bet Jack that he couldn’t go to the next shop and
do the same, and Jack said that he could; and he went into the second shop and called
for a bottle of whiskey again, the four of them drunk it off, and, taking off his
hat, he clapped it on the counter again saying that it was well paid for. The clerk
said, “Yes, Jack, it is all right.” They go to the last shop now, call for the third
bottle and do the same thing again. They wonder how he can do that and ask to buy
the hat. Jack said no. He asked them one hundred pounds for the hat, and the three
of them made it up and Jack gave them the hat and got the <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>hundred pounds and carried them to his wife. She was well pleased now.
</p>
<p>The three men started with the hat to see if they could get something by it also.
After buying some things, one of the men tried the hat and it wasn’t successful. The
other two were rowing with him, saying that wasn’t the way Jack did with the hat.
The second one now took it and went in, but the clerk was angry and was about to call
the police; they had to pay for what they called for there. Then there was a big row,
the other two saying that wasn’t the way Jack had done with the hat. Now the third
one tried it and was not successful. They threatened now to catch Jack and to kill
him.
</p>
<p>Jack knew what would happen and he told his wife he was going to put up a trick. He
went to the bed and lay down, and when the wife saw the three men coming she started
crying. They asked her what was the matter, and she said her husband was dead and
nobody to help her bury him. They said, “A devil act that! should have been dead before
now!” and asked to see him. Jack was lying in bed as if dead, and a stick beside him.
One of the men said, “Yes, me man, we were looking for you to kill you; we are glad
that you are dead already!” and he took up the stick beside him and gave him a wonderful
stroke. Jack started up with fright and said to them, “This is the stick of life!
it raised me from the dead!” and the wife was so glad to have her husband back again!
Well, the three fools asked Jack now to sell them the stick. Jack refused, but they
begged and Jack consented. They gave Jack one hundred fifty pounds for the stick because
it was the “stick of life.”
</p>
<p>The men started ’round the village advertising that they could raise the dead. The
king’s daughter was dead. They went to the king’s home and told him that they could
raise the dead, and he was glad and carried them inside where the daughter was lying
dead. They began beating her with a stick and crying, “Princess, arise from the dead!”
but nothing happened. The king was angry, ordered the furnace well heated and had
them thrown into it. That was the end of the three men, and Jack was well rid of them.

So, nearly to dinner-time, somebody say, “Hi! how is it nearly dinner-time an’ not’ing

</p>
<p>There was two sons named Big Begum and Little Begum. Big Begum was very rich <span class="corr" id="xd32e7718" title="Source: ane">and</span> Little Begum was very poor. One <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>day, Little Begum found a bag of money and sent to Big Begum to borrow his quart pan
to measure the money. Big Begum was very envious, didn’t like to see Little Begum
prosper. So he wondered what Little Begum was doing with the quart pan. He got some
grease and greased the bottom of the pan to find out. Little Begum measured the money
and, not looking in the pan to see that a coin had fastened in the bottom, sent it
back to Big Begum. Big Begum saw the money in the pan and was surprised to know where
Little Begum got this money from, so he threatened Little Begum if he did not tell
him he would kill him.
</p>
<p>So Little Begum told him that he had killed three of his horses, carried the meat
to the market and hung it up in the market crying out, “Fresh meat for sale, bit a
pound!” Big Begum now went home, killed three of his horses and carried the meat to
the market and gave the same alarm; but no one came to buy it. So he was so sorry!
</p>
<p>He went back home, called Little Begum, put him in a bag and tied him on a tree to
stay till he came back. While Little Begum was there, he saw a man passing with a
herd of sheep and he cried out. The man went up and asked what was the matter. He
said that Big Begum wanted him to go to him and he did not want to go. So the man
with the herd of sheep said he wanted to go, and Little Begum told him to take him
out the bag if he wished to get there. The man took him out and went into the bag;
Little Begum tied it as tight as he could, and the man told him to take charge of
the herd of sheep. So he went away with the herd of sheep, leaving the man there.
</p>
<p>Big Begum came up now with his cutlass and chopped the bag so fine that he could hardly
believe it was a man, and buried it. So when he buried it, he went round the corner
whistling and singing beautiful songs, feeling quite happy that he had killed Little
Begum. But as he turned the corner, he saw Little Begum with the herd of sheep. He
was so surprised! He said, “Is that you, Little Begum? I thought I had chopped you
up a while ago and buried you!” Little Begum said, “If you had chopped me up a little
finer and buried me a little deeper, I would get a herd of cows instead of a herd
of sheep!” So Big Begum told Little Begum to chop him up as fine and bury him as deep,
so he might get the cows. So Little Begum chopped him up very fine and buried him.
That was the End of Big Begum!

</p>
<p>Once a lady had two sons; one was very foolish and the other was very wise. The wise
one was hired to look after some sheep while the foolish one was to stay at home and
mind the mother. One day the mother became very ill and the wise brother had to leave
his work and come home, so he sent the foolish brother to go mind the sheep. So the
foolish boy took a stick and broke the legs of the sheep and brought them home in
the yard.
</p>
<p>The wise brother had on a bath on the fire for the mother. It was piping hot. So the
wise brother went to the owner of the sheep to tell what had happened to the sheep
and to ask for pardon, so he told the foolish brother to take off the pot off the
fire and give the mother a sponging while he was away. The foolish brother took off
the piping bath and put his mother in a tub and poured the hot bath on her, and she
died.
</p>
<p>When the wise brother came home and found that his mother was dead, he was so disappointed
because the owner of the sheep said as soon as their mother died he would take away
their lands to pay for his sheep. So the sheep-owner took away the land and left them
with only an iron gate. So both of them lifted the iron gate on their backs and began
to travel. As they reached a tree they sat down to rest. While they were there, they
saw a band of robbers coming; so both of them with the iron gate mounted the tree.
The robbers came and sat under the tree and began to eat. But they had no custard
and no vinegar and they wanted some. So the foolish brother in the tree said, “Brother,
I want to werine!” So he said, “You may do so,” and so he did. The robbers underneath
saw it coming down. Thinking it was vinegar, they took a pan and caught some and said,
“Thank the Lord! the Lord has sent vinegar for us.” Again the foolish brother said,
“I want to dédé!” So he did, and the robbers caught some, thinking it was custard,
and said, “Thank the Lord! the Lord has sent down custard for us.” So both of them
in the tree now became tired of holding the iron gate, so they dropped it. The robbers
were so frightened that they ran away leaving everything, and the two brothers came
down out of the tree and took up all the money that was left and a knife.
</p>
<p>The robbers sent one of the men to see what it was, and the two brothers took the
knife and cut off his tongue and sent him back. When the robbers saw him coming, they
ran to meet him <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>and asked him what was the matter. He could only say to them, “Bla, bla, bla!” They
were so frightened that they started running, he running after them calling out “Bla!
bla! bla!” They ran until they were out of breath and fell down and could go no further.

</p>
<p>There was a poor man and his wife and two children. He had nothing to give them but
a slice of bread and cold water for the day. So one day he got up, took the children
into the bush and pretended to be chopping the tree; then, as the children were playing,
slipped away. When the wife asked for the children, he told her he had left them in
the bush and she fretted and worried all day. Life became easier for them day by day,
and the man became sorry that he had left them in the wood.
</p>
<p>The children, when they missed their father, started to travel through the wood to
see if they could find their way home. A little black bird said to them, “Follow me
and I will show you your way home!” but this little black bird was an Old Witch. It
carried them to a house made out of nothing but cakes, sweets and all manner of nice
things, and then the bird vanished away from them. But they were so glad to get the
cakes and sweets that they began eating at once. Immediately as they touched the first
cake, the door of the house opened and a very ugly-looking blind old woman came out
to them and asked them what they were doing there; so they told her how they had been
lost in the bush. She took them into the house, put one in a cage and had one to do
all the work of the house. Every evening she went to feed the one in the cage, and
asked him to stick out his hand to see if he was getting fat; so the one left in the
house gave him a bone to stretch out instead, because the Old Witch was blind and
could only feel. The one in the cage was getting very fat and rosy. One day she went
to the cage and asked him to stretch out his hand and the child stretched out the
bone; so she became very impatient, said she couldn’t wait any longer and would kill
him that very day for dinner, and asked the one in the house to heat up the oven.
Then the Witch told the one in the house to see if the oven was hot enough; the Witch
was going to shut the door on her and let her stay in there and bake. But the girl
was smart and said she did not know how to get into it, she must show her the way.
As the Witch went into the oven, she pushed <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>her in and shut the door, and the Witch stood in there squealing till she was burned
to death. Then the girl ran and took the boy out of the cage, took some of the cakes
and nice things off the house, and ran to their own home. The parents were so glad
to see them that they kept a ball for them that night, and they told the story how
they had killed the Witch.

<p>Once a little boy went to the river to bathe. He was washed away to sea and his parents
heard nothing about him, but he was told before going that if he went he would be
drowned.
</p>
<p>But he was a smart little boy. A mermaid came and took him and carried him to the
bottom of the sea and asked him certain questions: If he ate fish? he said “No.” If
he ate beef? he said “No.” If he ate mutton? he said “No.” If he ate pork? he said
“No.” If he had said “Yes,” the mermaid would have killed him, because its body was
made of fish, beef, mutton and pork. So, as he didn’t eat any of those things, the
mermaid carried him to the shore, threw him out, and a sheep took him up. The master
of the sheep asked him certain questions,—where he was from and what was his name.
He told him and they carried him to his home. They were so glad to see him they went
and invited friends to come and help them enjoy themselves and make merry.

<p>A poor man was once <span class="corr" id="xd32e7815" title="Source: traveling">travelling</span> and saw a dog and a lion and a crow and ants fighting over dead prey. The poor man
had nothing but a knife. He said, “Let me try and see if I can help you all.” He cut
one quarter gave to the lion, cut one quarter gave to the dog, cut one quarter gave
to the crow, gave the last quarter to the ants. The lion said, “My good man, I have
nothing to pay for you kindness, but any trouble you get into just call upon the lion
and you shall be ten times stronger than the lion.” The dog said, “Any trouble you
get into just say, ‘The grey the dog,’ and you shall be ten times quicker than the
dog.” The crow said, “Say, ‘The grey the crow,’ and you shall fly ten times higher
than the crow.” The ants said, “Say, ‘The grey the ants,’ and you shall be ten times
smaller than the ants.”
</p>
<p>Some time after that, a great seven-headed giant who had one daughter, made a rule
that any man coming to his house he would surely put to death. That poor man heard
about the saying of the seven-headed giant and said he would marry the daughter. They
laughed at him, but he found himself at the giant’s yard. There he found the daughter,
but the giant was not at home. He told her that he would marry her, and she said that
the giant would kill him. He said that he would give the giant a fight. He went back
the second day, went back the third day. The father caught him there, said to his
daughter in the house, “Aye! I smell fresh blood!”—“No, papa, nothing of the kind!”
The giant went into the room she was hiding the man in. The man said, “The grey the
ants,” and he was ten times smaller than ants; found his way through the crevices,
ran down the stair-case, found himself out on the green, and he came back into his
man’s shape. The giant came out and caught hold of him. He called upon the lion and
he was ten times stronger than a lion. He flashed off three of the giant’s heads.
</p>
<p>All the giant’s treasure was hidden in a round hill and the key was two marbles on
an iron rod. The two marbles and the rod dropped from the giant’s pocket. “The grey
the dog,” and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>was ten times quicker than a dog and caught the marbles and the rod. The giant caught
after him and he said, “The grey the crow,” and flew ten times higher than a crow,
and flew down and hit off the other four heads. The giant was lying down dead. With
the advice of the girl he walked straight up to the hill, joined the iron rod on the
top of the hill, set the two marbles at the other side at the foot of the hill, and
both marbles rolled to the iron rod. So the man went in and got all that hidden treasure
and he married the daughter and got all the possessions.

<p>Devil had his company in his house, had a woman also locked up while Jack, his servant,
was heating the oven. Somebody was expected from home. Jack was very fond of that
girl, promised her that if anybody will come from home, he will keep heating the oven.
The two of them arrange that she will keep singing—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Wah wah oo, wah wah oo, wah wah oo,
</p>
<p class="line">Nobody coming from Prince of Wales?”</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“No, no, madame; no, no, madame; no, no, madame;
</p>
<p class="line">Nobody coming from Prince of Wales.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The master came to the window; “Jack, is the oven hot?”—“No, Master, not yet hot.”
Jack put in two bundles of wood more. About an hour after, the girl began the same
song. Jack gave the same reply. Master came again; “Jack, is the oven hot?”—“No, Master,
not yet hot.”
</p>
<p>The girl’s father came. The girl started singing—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Wah wah oo, wah wah oo, wah wah oo,

<div class="lgouter">

</p>
<p class="line">Somebody coming from Prince of Wales!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The master came to the window; “Jack, is the oven hot?”—“Yes, Master, red-hot!” Coming
down the staircase the father drew a revolver and shot him. Jack has to put him in
the oven, and Jack, the girl, and all the company make a feast of him. The father
took Jack and the girl back to his house and married them both for life.

<p>A little boy once heard of a king’s daughter who would answer any riddle, and so he
told his mother that he was going to ask the king’s daughter a riddle. Whatever riddle
the king’s daughter asks him, if he can’t answer, the king’s daughter will kill him;
or else, he will get the king’s daughter. And the mother made some dumpling and gave
to him, made six, poisoned one. And he eat four and gave two to the donkey he was
riding, and one of those two was the one that was poisoned. So “Poor Lo” died. So
seven John-crow came to eat Poor Lo; so while the seven John-crow were eating Poor
Lo, they were dying one after another <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>by the poison of Poor Lo. And he saw an orange-tree with one ripe orange on it, and
he went and picked it and eat it, and he picked up one under the tree and eat it.
And Jack went to the king’s daughter, and she asked him the riddle; and after he answered
it, he asked her this one:
</p>
<p>“Two kill one and one kill seven; the top of the tree was sweet, but the bottom was
sweeter yet.”

one hundred mile. When he got to a pen de master said, “You little too late; I jus’
got a butcher dis mo’ning.” He walk anodder one hundred mile an’ when he go he succeed
a butcher. He was doin’ his work one year, never drew no money—one hundred pound a
year. When de year was up, de missis said to him, “Out of you money an’ t’ree advice,
which one you rather?” He said, “I rather <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>de t’ree advice.” She give him one revolver an’ give him a loaf of bread an’ give

De t’ree advice—“Not to forsake de bridge which you cross; not to interfere in politics;
you mustn’t in haste in temper.” An’ him tek his journey.

I rather de t’ree advice, and she give me dis loaf of bread; not to cut it till I
reach home, but she give me my pocket-money.” De wife said, “What about de t’ree advice

<p>Once Anansi went out to invite a friend to dinner. Little Molly May was his servant,
so he left her to roast a turkey for dinner. Anansi filled the wine-jug, laid the
table, put on his frock coat and his top hat, took his walking-stick and went out
for his friend. Molly May roasted the turkey. Seeing that it looked so nice and charming,
she thought that she would take a piece; so she did, and it tasted so nice she took
another piece. That tasted so nice she took a next piece and a sip of the wine, and
she sipped and tasted till at last she had eaten up the whole turkey and drunk the
whole of the wine.
</p>
<p>She saw the master coming; so she ran in swift haste, took up the bones, fixed them
nicely in the dish, covered the dish, and carried it and laid it on the table. When
the master came, he sent the visitor into the house and said to Molly May, “Hullo,
deh! everyt’ing all right?” She said, “Yes, sah! all is right.” So the master took
up the carving-knife and went outside to sharpen it. Molly ran inside and told the
visitor that the master was sharpening the knife to cut off one of his hands; the
visitor in swift haste left the house. Then Molly went outside and told the master
that the visitor had eaten all the turkey and drunk the wine. The master ran through
one door and, seeing all the bones on the table, went through the other. The visitor
was running for his life and Anansi went running after him, calling “Leave one! leave
one!” He meant leave one (side of) the turkey, but the visitor thought he meant one
of his hands, so he ran for his life.

He is a big boss up there and he’s carrying a gang. But one trouble, he has no Sunday

</p>
<p>Rat says no.
</p>
<p>Saw Puss coming along. “Do, Br’er Puss, I beg you kill this rat, make this rat gnaw
this grease, make this grease grease this rope, make this rope hang this butcher,
make this butcher kill this cow, make this cow drink this water, make this water out
this fire, make this fire burn this stick, make this stick lick this dog, make this
dog bite this pig, make this pig jump over this river, make Anansi get home!”
</p>
<p>Puss says, “Yes, I will kill your rat!”
</p>
<p>Rat says, “Before you kill me, I will gnaw the grease!”
</p>
<p>Grease says, “Before you gnaw me, I will grease the rope!”
</p>
<p>Rope says, “Before you grease me, I will hang the butcher!”
</p>
<p>Butcher says, “Before you hang me, I will kill the cow!”
</p>
<p>Cow says, “Before you kill me, I will drink the water!”
</p>
<p>Water says, “Before you drink me, I will out the fire!”
</p>
<p>Fire says, “Before you out me, I will burn the stick!”
</p>
<p>Stick says, “Before you burn me, I will lick the dog!”
</p>
<p>Dog says, “Before you lick me, I will bite the pig!”
</p>
<p>Pig says, “Before you bite me, I will jump over the river!”
</p>
<p>So away went the pig over the river; and him and Anansi went home safe and without
expense.

<p class="footnote first">“Then said the king, ‘Come to me not clothed, not naked, not riding, not walking,
not in the road, not out of the road, and if thou canst do that I will marry thee.’
So she went away, put off everything she had on, and then she was not clothed, and
took a great fishing net, and seated herself in it and wrapped it entirely round and
round her, and then she was not naked, and she hired an ass and tied the fisherman’s
net to its tail, so that it was forced to drag her along, and that was neither riding
nor walking. The ass had also to drag her in the ruts, so that she only touched the
ground with her great toe, and that was neither being in the road nor out of the road.”</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Parkes heard this story in St. Ann Parish. Milne-Home, 99–108, tells it of Anansi
and “Lion,” who takes the place of Tiger in earlier Jamaica story-telling. In a famous
Jamaica digging-song, the words “Tiger-Lion” are coupled much as we should say “John
Smith.”
</p>
<p>The story falls into three parts. (1) A bully takes for himself the food-supply of
one weaker than himself, who dares not object. (2) The bully is tricked into allowing
himself to be tied; when he is tormented or robbed of the food he is monopolizing.
(3) He either dies, or he is rescued and (a) falls upon his rescuer, <span class="corr" id="xd32e13868" title="Source: of">or</span> (b) invites him to dinner, when he is again tricked by his first victim, who personates
the animal who has released him and enjoys his hospitality until detected and pursued.
</p>
<p>Compare: Callaway, 29; 358; Theal, 110; Jacottet, 20–22; Dayrell, 93–97; Barker, 55–58;
Cronise and Ward, 209–213; Ellis, Ewe 274; Rattray, 2: 74–82; Smith, 549–551; Lenz,
41; Christensen, 23–25; Harris, Nights, 327–329; Friends, 21–23; Ernst, VBGAEU 20:
275; Koch-Grünberg, 2: 141; Saurière, 95–100; Lenz, Estudios, 202, 210.
</p>
<p>(1) The fish-basket story occurs in Dayrell and in Barker (antelope in a bundle).
In Milne-Home, Anansi catches the fish by pretending he is going to give them new
life.
</p>
<p>(2) The tying trick is variously treated. In Callaway, 29, and Theal, the “cannibal’s”
hair is plaited into the thatch, in Jacottet, the tail; in Callaway, 358, the tail
is fastened into the ground. In Dayrell, the two play at tying each other (as in numbers
16 and 37) and the weaker animal refuses to untie the stronger. In Barker, the stronger
animal consents to be hung in order to have his teeth beautifully filed. In Cronise
&amp; Ward and in the American versions (Harris, Christensen, Lenz, Ernst), the tying
takes place under pretence of storm, but a pretence made plausible by shaking <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>the trees as if a storm were coming. In Jacottet’s story, Lion, whose tail has been
thatched into the hut, prays for a storm to kill his tormentor; it comes and destroys
Lion himself. In Koch-Grünberg (Taulipang), the story is mixed with the motive of
the support of the stone.
</p>
<p>Tormenting the tied victim by throwing at him the remnants of the feast occurs in
Theal, Cronise &amp; Ward, Dayrell (salt and pepper). In Callaway and Lenz, he is severely
beaten.
</p>
<p>(3) Release by “White-ants” occurs in Barker, Cronise &amp; Ward, Smith; by “Bush-rat”
in Dayrell, where the story ends, as in number 12c, by the released victim falling
upon his rescuer. In Milne-Home, this motive is also suggested. In Ellis, “Bush-rat”
is freed by “Snail.” Compare Nassau, 46, where the swollen Leopard, freed from his
predicament by Crab, turns and eats up his rescuer. The overheard invitation occurs
in Barker, Smith, Milne-Home.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The two episodes do not, so far as I know, occur in African collections, and in American
collections they belong to a single story.
</p>
<p>Compare: (Mexico), Boas, JAFL 25: 205; Parsons, Andros Island 82–85; Sea Islands,
40–43; Edwards, 63; JAFL 30: 229<span id="xd32e13892"></span>; Backus, JAFL 13: 22–24; JAFL 32: 400–402; Harris, Nights, 12–17; 179–185; Uncle
Remus 140–145; Hichiti Indians, JAFL 26: 214.
</p>
<p>In Edward’s and Parsons’s versions, the two episodes of tying in the garden and tying
up while the water is scalding belong together; one is the conclusion of the other.
In Mrs. Parsons’s version, the boy says when he finds Boukee tied in place of Rabby,
“O pa! de leetle man grow beeg!” Edward’s version says, “Pa, dey big one here!”—“Don’t
care if ’e big one or little one, I goin’ to scal’ him!” is the answer. In Boas’s
Mexican Rabbit cycle, Rabbit is caught in a woman’s chile-garden by means of the tar-baby,
is hung in a net while water is heating, pretends he is to marry, and persuades Coyote
into his place. The “dear old woman” says “Ah! How did the Rabbit turn into a coyote?”
</p>
<p>The story is related to Grimm 8, <span class="corr" id="xd32e13897" title="Source: dicussed">discussed</span> by Bolte u. Polívka 1: 68. In Boas’s Mexican cycle, Rabbit escapes from Coyote by
leaving him playing the guitar for a marriage couple. Anansi is represented as an

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story is very common in Jamaica and presents no local variations from the form
familiar in America. In Parkes’s version, the “two misses” become two “post-mistresses”.
In a version by Knight, a school-master in the Santa Cruz mountains, Tacoomah is the
horse and the story ends, “From that day the saddle fasten on Brer Tacoomah’s back.”
Knight explained that “Brer Tacoomah is a large spider with yellow spots and a broad
back shaped like a saddle,” and that the story was told to explain this characteristic.
</p>
<p>Other Jamaica versions are found in Milne-Home, 51–63; Pamela Smith, 17; and Wona,
19–23. In Wona’s version, the story is made to explain “why gungo-peas are always
covered with Tacoomahs,” a species of spider.
</p>
<p>Compare Parsons, Andros Island, 30 and note; Sea Islands, 53; for comparative references.
</p>
<p>Tremearne, FL 21:205, and Tailed-Head-Hunters, 322, tells a Hausa story of a Hyena
who has stolen a holy man’s horse. Spider offers to bring the Hyena to him in its
place, and persuades Hyena, under pretence of taking him to a dead animal, to be saddled
and bridled and ridden by Spider to the holy man, who then mounts Hyena and completes
his journey.
</p>
<p>In Ellis, Yoruba 265, Tortoise rides Elephant into town to sustain an idle boast.
</p>
<p>In Smith’s Brazil version, the little animal is tied on for safety, and takes care
to slip into a hole when he finally dismounts.
</p>

is coupled here with the murder in mid-stream.

<p class="first">Parkes heard this story in St. Ann Parish. Wona, 62–67, tells how Anansi steals Monkey’s
clothes and passes the theft off on “Bone.”
</p>
<p>Compare: Tremearne, FL 21:352; Harris, Nights; 68–74; Parsons, Sea Islands, 145<span class="corr" id="xd32e13978" title="Source: :">;</span> JAFL 32:366.
</p>
<p>The common theme of teaching to an unsuspecting comrade an incriminating song (as
in Parsons, Sea Islands, 145) is here emphasized by a second intrigue, that of the
sheep-skin suit. The idea seems related to the next number. In Wona, 30–36, Tacoomah
puts on a sheep-skin and hides in the fold from which the sheep are being stolen,
Anansi ties and accuses him because he wears the sheep-skin.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> Tiger Catching the Sheep-thief. <span class="storyLink">[<a href="#ch5">Story</a>]</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story of the sheep-thief and the disguised watchman is popular in Jamaica, especially
in St. Ann Parish, and I have given three versions in order to show the range of variation
and the persistence of the essential plot. I have abbreviated White’s version without
other change except the insertion of the incident of the misunderstood warning, which
comes from another version and commonly precedes the episode of the “refugees in the
roof.” Besides these three versions, Wona has the story, 30–36, and in Jekyll, 88,
Tiger puts on a similar disguise at the conclusion of Annancy and Candle-fly (see
number <a href="#ch7">7</a>).
</p>
<p>The tale falls into three parts. (1) A flock of sheep disappear one by one. (2) Tiger,
or his equivalent, puts on the animal’s skin in order to catch the thief. (3) The
thief is caught, but escapes his captor; or he provides a substitute; or he is pursued
and takes refuge in the roof.
</p>
<p>Compare: Tremearne, 214–216; Barker, 131–132; Parsons, Andros Island, 117–119; Edwards,
67–68.
</p>
<p>(1) The witty opening of the Jamaica versions based on a compensation motive (see
numbers <a href="#ch22">22</a> and <a href="#ch63">63</a>), in which the rascal takes advantage of an open-handedness common to aristocratic
wealth, does not occur outside Jamaica. Compare Tremearne, FL 21: 213–214. In Parsons,
he pleads his wife’s illness; in Edwards and Barker, he is a mere thief. In Barker,
as in Jamaica, the story accepts the absurdity that all the sheep have disappeared
except the last.
</p>
<p>(2) The thief-catcher is “head-man” in Edwards as in Jamaica; in Barker he is a man
who comes to town; in Wona, he is Tacoomah; in Parsons, a lion gets in with the sheep
and is taken as the plumpest of them.
</p>
<p>(3) Barker’s version has a moralizing tendency; it is the friend who accompanies the
thief who, at a flash of lightning, detects the trap and escapes. In Edwards, as in
version (b), the rascal shifts the burden to his unsuspecting accomplice and himself
escapes. Edwards and Parsons both conclude with the episode of taking refuge in the
roof, as in version (c). For references see Parsons, 117 note 2.
</p>
<p>For the incident of the misunderstood warning, compare: Tremearne, FL 21: 206; Renel
2: 7, 8; Theal, 165; Harris, Nights, 82; Trowbridge, JAFL 9: 286.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the essential plot is a version of the Sindibad fable of
the thief among the beasts, who caught the lion by mistake, told in Comparetti’s translation
from the Portuguese <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>in his “Researches Concerning the Book of Sindibad”, PFLS 9: 144. A rich herder camps
beside a village at night. A prowling lion gets among the beasts. A thief comes and,
feeling the animals to see which is the plumpest, lays hands upon the lion.

<p class="first">Jekyll tells the same story in Annancy and Candle-fly, 86–89<span class="corr" id="xd32e14049" title="Source: ,">;</span> Wona, in Anancy and Fire-fly, 24–29; Pamela Smith, in Anancy and Ginger-fly. Milne-Home,
35–39, contains the scorpion episode. Compare Tremearne FL 21: 360.
</p>
<p>The plot is in two parts. (1) Anansi goes on an egg-hunt at night with Fire-fly as
guide, but is deserted because of his greed. (2) He stumbles upon Tiger’s house at
night, and tries to steal back the eggs which Tiger has set Scorpions to guard. The
parallel of this story with number <a href="#ch39">39</a> is obvious. Jekyll’s version takes on elements of the sheep-stealing story, number
<a href="#ch5">5</a>. A Mandeville version reads much like Milne-Home’s:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Bra Anansi an’ Bra Tiger went out to go an’ steal some eggs. Bra Anansi took a rubber
bag an’ Bra Tiger took a canvas bag. When Bra Tiger bag full, Bra Anansi jus’ half.
Bra Tiger would not wait any longer. He leave him an’ he go away.
</p>
<p>Anansi was filling the bag, there he see a light coming, think it was Bra Tiger an’
cry out, “Lor’, Bra’r, Bra’r, yo’ jus’ coming to meet me?” But it wasn’t Tiger; it
was the man watchin’ the eggs.
</p>
<p>An’ when he went up to hol’ him he said, “Do, sah! do, sah! don’ carry me to massah
to-night. Tie me to yo’ bed-side to-night till a mawnin’!” An’ when the man was sleeping,
he call to Bra Rat, “Bra’r Rat, run come here let me tell you somethin’!” When Bra
Rat come he said, “Jes’ loose me, I hev some egg here to give you!” An’ he loose him,
he simply went right away,—never give Bra Rat anything.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The popular story of the bone-hole is better in action than on paper. A lad in Ballard’s
Valley gave me a similar story of John-Crow’s bone-hole, ending with the dash of boiling
water which has rendered John-Crow permanently bald (see number <a href="#ch47">47</a>). After dictating the story he said, “Now I will tell it so as to make it funny”,
and he proceeded to retell the tale in rapid dialogue, <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>changing his voice to imitate the speakers and representing in pantomime the action
of eating and throwing the bones, of ducking to escape them, and of playing the fiddle.
As in this case, the dictated stories often only approximately render the style of
actual oral delivery.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Jamaica version of this wide-spread tale (Grimm 3, discussed in Bolte u. Polívka,
1: 9–13), has no local peculiarities. Compare Parsons, Sea Islands, 5–9 and references;
also Frobenius 3: 13–16.
</p>
<p>It consists of two parts. (1) A rascal excuses himself three times for leaving his
companion, on the plea of a summons to a christening, in order to rob a tub of butter
which the two hold in common. (2) By smearing the innocent companion with the butter,
he makes him appear the guilty one.
</p>
<p>The first part is the distinguishing feature of the tale. A stolen food-supply is
one of the commonest episodes in negro trickster stories and common tests to detect
the thief occur:—(a) Taking a purge to detect stolen food as in Dennett, 92. (b) Jumping
over a fire, as in Harris, Uncle Remus, 84; Nights, 253–254; JAFL 30: 193; 32: 394;
and numbers <a href="#ch21a">21a</a> and <a href="#ch36">36</a>. (See Bolte u. Polívka 1: 39). (c) Jumping over, or walking, a string, as in Theal,
115; Junod, 105; Boas and Simango JAFL 35: 193; Compare also Monk Lewis’s story of
the test in crossing a river, 253–254, illustrated in number <a href="#ch80">80</a>.
</p>
<p>The trick to “incriminate another fellow” is, regularly, to smear the innocent victim
with food while he sleeps. Compare: Bleek, 18; Callaway, 169; Theal, 93–97; Junod,
102; Dayrell, 53–54; Harris, Uncle Remus, 83; Parsons, Sea Islands, 8–14; also, Haida
Indians, Swanton 113 (Bur. of Am. Ethn. Bull. 29).
</p>
<p>The blood-smearing of the innocent victim in Leopard’s Marriage Journey, Nassau, 85–95,
is a particular instance of the same motive. The sheep-skin suit and the song in the
mouth of the unsuspecting victim, serve as witty substitutes for this common device
for the incriminating of an innocent person by the guilty.
</p>
<p>In Arcin, 473, the common food-supply is stored in a granary of which Rabbit steals
the key, eats the food, and scatters the remains in the house of the guardian Hyena.

<p>In all these cases, the trickster proposes diving and eats a store of food while his
companion is in the water. The grotesque idea of bodily dismemberment coupled with
the diving episode, I do not find in any of the parallels noted. In Parsons, Andros
Island, 73, Boukee and Elephant go out bird-hunting. Boukee shoots Elephant and brings
him home to the family. Boukee is brought to justice because the children are overheard

<p>(1) Only Jones, Parsons and the Jamaica version (a) have the introduction, which suggests
the story (Grimm 4) of the lad who did not know what fear was.

Great Russian Animal Tales, 12, 16) the rascal gives his <span class="corr" id="xd32e14188" title="Source: victem">victim</span> a bull-dog in a bag and bids him let it out in an open field. In Parsons, he sets
on fire the deep grass in which his victim lies sleeping. In Zeltner, Hyena and Hare
catch four lion cubs; Hare pretends to kill his two, and Hyena follows his supposed
example. In Tremearne, Hyena and Jerboa on a wedding journey are lodged in the goat-house
and the fowl-house respectively. Jerboa proposes they have a feast, then counsels
the host to count the fowls and the goats. None <span class="corr" id="xd32e14191" title="Source: ot">of</span> his fowl are missing, but Hyena has eaten a goat. In Ferrand, Madagascar, 207, it
is proposed to kill mothers. One pretends to, the other thinks it real and does it.

her, pretends to be tearing out and eating her own entrails. Bear tries to do the

<p class="first">The trick to save a mother in time of famine from a mutual agreement of sacrifice
to hunger, has a great vogue in Jamaica. I got two versions, and Pamela Smith tells
it as “Parrot, Tiger and Anancy,” 52–54.

Parsons, Andros Island, 116–117; JAFL 30: 230–231.
</p>
<p>Only in the Jamaica versions and in Parsons does the trick consist in teaching a hidden
name. In P. Smith, after saving his mother by teaching her the new name, Anansi hides
her in a tree and the story follows 17 a. Dayrell, and Harris 237–241, tell the tree
story. In <span class="corr" id="xd32e14223" title="Source: Dennet">Dennett</span>, she is hidden in a cave, where she is discovered by treachery and killed. In Harris
233–236, Wolf’s mother is taken first to market and sold, and Rabbit tricks Wolf out
of horses, wagon and provisions by the familiar device of burying the tails; but the
story is incomplete, as it does not explain how Anansi got out of the bargain. In
Fortier, the two mothers are tied, one with a rope, the other with a cob-web, and
one mother escapes. The tying trick precedes the tail-burying in Parson’s Portuguese
version, JAFL 30: 230–231.

story; the trickster hides his relative in a tree in order to evade his share of the
bargain.

<p>In Bleek, 7, 9, and Theal, 190, a trickster offers to act as carrier for the Lion’s
prey, conveys it to a height, then pretends to draw the Lion up with a rope but lets
him fall when he is part way up.
</p>
<p>Version (b). The version is so incomplete that its connections are difficult to trace.
In Chatelain, 133, when the women from Sun and Moon who have come to draw water go
back up to heaven on the cobweb that Spider has woven, Frog goes along with them to
woo the daughter of Sun and Moon for his master. In Dennett, 74, the Spider climbs
up to the blue vault of heaven and draws up the other animals to woo Nzambi’s daughter.

<p>Versions (c) and (d). In Parsons, Andros Island, 5–7, the trickster visits some fat
pea-fields in the air belonging to “dose speerits which you call witch people” and

<p class="first">This story is told everywhere in Jamaica, but I find no African version and Mrs. Parsons
says (JAFL 32: 391) that, although she heard it “over and over again” in South Carolina,
it was altogether unknown in North Carolina; see Sea Islands, 1–5. Such a distribution
argues a fairly modern origin for the complete form of the story.
</p>
<p>The story has two parts. (1) Two friends, who have, one a dog and the other a dog-head,
go hunting, and the owner of the dog-head claims the spoils for his own. (2) His companion,
who dares not dispute him, recovers the spoils by pretending that the owner is come
to punish the theft.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>An introduction sometimes tells how the friends come by the dog and dog-head. Each
gets a present of a dog, but one is so greedy that he eats his down, beginning at
the tail, until only the head is left. When his friend jeers at him, he makes a bet
that his dog-head will catch the prey. The business of deciding at which end to begin
to eat the dog is used as a humorous episode detached from the rest of the story,
the victim sometimes escaping in the meantime.
</p>
<p>The trick of claiming the cow as the prey of the dog-head may be related to such stories
as that of Basset 2: 88, in which the man lays the new-born calf beside his own bull
and declares that the bull has mothered it.

</p>
<p>Version (a). Of all the devices to catch a thief, the tar-baby story is by far the
most popular in Jamaica. Despite its conformity to negro practices, the uniformity
of style in which the story is treated shows that it is not here developed upon a
naturalistic basis. On the other hand, the trick of the escape into the habitat does
not often occur in Jamaica, perhaps because it is more amusing when coupled with the
figure of Rabbit, as in 59 a. For other instances of the fire-test see notes to number
9.
</p>
<p>Version (b). Jamaica thief stories lay emphasis upon the unexpectedness of the thief’s
identity. In version (a) and in number <a href="#ch50">50</a>, it is the watchman himself who is robbing the garden. In (b) it is the intimate
friend. In (c) it is the father of the family. Pains are taken, moreover, to divert
suspicion. In number <a href="#ch20">20</a>, Anansi establishes an alibi by playing all night at a dance while his gang rob the
field; in Junod, 102, Rabbit makes his companion put him under a mortar at night and
fasten his feet, then wriggles out of the trap and returns to it again. The device
in version (b) seems to be native to Jamaica.

<p>The escape by means of a substitute is more dramatically handled than in Mrs. Parsons’s
Bahama versions, 15–16, but as Goat is generally a wary animal in Jamaica stories,
the ending must be derived from the “Boukee and Rabby” cycle of the Bahama and Louisiana
equivalents. For the substitute theme, compare numbers <a href="#ch2">2</a>, <a href="#ch4">4</a>, <a href="#ch5b">5b</a>, <a href="#ch10b">10b</a>, <a href="#ch58">58</a>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to Mrs. Parson’s analysis in Andros Island, 2–10, the story of the lost
pass takes four forms: (1) across water, (2) inside a tree, (3) to the sky, (4) inside
the cow. To all these passages, a magic pass is attached, and either a violated prohibition
or a forgotten pass-word traps the intruder until the master of the place appears.
</p>
<p>In Jamaica, the story is very popular. (1) occurs in numbers <a href="#ch7">7</a>, <a href="#ch39">39</a>, <a href="#ch58">58</a>, out of which, however, the pass-word has dropped; (2) is wanting; (3) is found in
number <a href="#ch17">17</a>; (4) appears in numbers <a href="#ch6">6</a> and <a href="#ch38">38</a> and in a number of current versions which contain the episode of cutting meat from
inside the cow, but lack the other elements of the story.
</p>
<p>For the pattern of Parkes’s story, which falls into five parts, compare: Tremearne,
257–260; Ellis, Yoruba, 271; Barker, 81–84; Cronise and Ward, 231–238; Nassau, 35–37;
202–207; Fortier, 31; 111; Harris, Uncle Remus, 166–168; Christensen, 108; Edwards,
77; Parsons, Andros Island, 2–10; Rattray, 2: 88.
</p>
<p>(1) The trickster discovers food in a neighbor’s possession in Tremearne, Nassau,
203, Fortier, 31, Harris, Christensen, Edwards, Parsons, 3, 4, 27.
</p>
<p>(2) His impatience leads him to create a “mock sunrise.” In Tremearne, he burns the
roof; in Christensen, he sets a tree on fire; in Ellis, he simulates the cock-crowing;
in Barker, he makes the children rattle their spoons and sweep the floor.
</p>
<p>In Parkes’s version, Anansi wakens at the cow-boy’s bell, and the reference to the
“river-side” connects the story with the crossing water variant. As in Cronise and
Ward, after learning the trick from his friend, he goes off alone for a supply without
calling his neighbor.
</p>
<p>In Jones, 11–14, and Harris, Friends, 6–11, the Sun promises to find food for the
hungry Hawk if he can ever catch him in bed. <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>When Rooster finally wakes Hawk in time to catch the Sun, the angry lord gives Hawk
permission to catch chickens.
</p>
<p>(3) In cutting the meat from inside the cow, in spite of warning he cuts a vital organ
in Nassau, Cronise and Ward, Harris, Fortier, Parsons, 9; and numbers <a href="#ch17c">17c</a> and <a href="#ch17d">17d</a> of this collection.
</p>
<p>In Fortier, 31 (see number <a href="#ch7">7</a>), instead of taking one egg from each nest as bidden, he takes all. In Ellis, he
forgets the pass-word.
</p>
<p>(4) When the owner of the dead cow comes to cut it up, the trickster hides in some
organ, which the owner’s daughter takes to the brook to wash. He jumps out, pretends
that he was in the brook bathing, complains of the insult and gets the cow as damages.
So Cronise and Ward, Nassau, Edwards. In Tremearne, he gets a whole elephant for himself.
</p>
<p>(5) He carries the cow away into a lonely place in order to enjoy the whole, and Dry-head
gets it away from him; see numbers <a href="#ch29">29</a>, <a href="#ch30">30</a>. The episode does not occur in other versions. In Cronise and Ward, he gets three
cows by means of the tail in the ground trick. In Harris, he is given his companion’s
head, who gets shut up with him and upon whom he has laid the blame of killing the
cow.

<p class="first">Parkes gave me the only version of this admirable story that I found in Jamaica and
I did not find it in this form in other American collections. The essential idea is
that of repeated attempts by a parent to turn over to an enemy an adroit child, who
each time outwits his would-be captor. The plot is common in Africa. In Rattray, Chinyanje,
133–136; Torrend, 183–185; Junod, 158–163, a woman steals from a monster, who demands
her unborn child in compensation. After his birth, the monster comes for his prey.
The parent attempts to beguile the child into his hands by sending him to fetch something
from the place where the monster lies concealed. Each time the child escapes. Finally
the child climbs a tree and throws down fruit (Torrend and Junod) or wood (Rattray)
into the open mouth of his enemy, thus choking and killing him.
</p>
<p>For a similar sequence of attempts to entrap a weaker enemy, compare the Coyote and
Rabbit cycle from Mexico, Boas, JAFL 25: 205, 236, 246, and 260 referring to Preuss;
and two versions of the same story by Mechling, JAFL 25: 201–202.
</p>
<p>Parkes’s version includes five episodes, three of which belong to the regular cycle;
the first and the last are indeterminate.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>(1) The child proves too clever for the parent. Barker, 24, says, “Anansi is the Spider,
and with him is generally associated his son, Kweku Tsin.” Stories about the two bring
out the superior wit of the son and the jealousy of the father. Compare numbers <a href="#ch19">19</a>, <a href="#ch21c">21c</a>, <a href="#ch24">24</a> in this collection.
</p>
<p>In the African stories cited above, the motive for seeking to entrap the child is
one of compensation for stolen food. In the Mexican cycle, the dull-witted strong
animal has been made to suffer punishment for a stolen food-supply, in place of the
real thief. In Jamaica, the child’s exposure of a hidden food-supply is used as the
motive.
</p>
<p>The story of the yam’s hidden name is universally known and enjoyed in Jamaica. It
belongs to the group of hidden-name stories discussed under number <a href="#ch69">69</a>. See Milne-Home, 56–57, De Affassia, and compare Musgrave, 53–54.
</p>
<p>(2), (3). The child first sticks a fire-stick into the pepper-bush behind which his
enemy lies in wait, then throws bags of ants into his face as he waits under a cocoanut
tree.
</p>
<p>In the African and Mexican parallels, the trickster throws down fruit,—prickly-pears
in Mexico. In every case, two fruits are thrown harmlessly, then the fatal fruit.
Compare Parsons, Andros Island, 40. In Georgia, Backus, JAFL 13: 22–23, pepper is
the missile. In Nassau, 25–30, bags of ants and pepper are thrown to detect the pretended
dead. This may be related to the bee trick in the Mexican cycle. In the Jamaica episode
of the “refugees in the roof,” numbers <a href="#ch5c">5c</a> and <a href="#ch27">27</a>, after the wife and children have dropped and been devoured, Anansi puffs dust into
the pursuer’s eyes and escapes. Dust is thrown in Parsons, Sea Islands, 54, and in
other instances in the same collection.

<p>(4) For the episode of detecting a hidden enemy by calling upon the place where he
is hidden to speak, compare Steere, 377; Rattray, 134; Renel 2: 92, 93; Fortier, 110;

food supply. (2) He takes all but one fruit and charms that so that his father cannot
pick it. (3) Dog picks it up and swallows it, is pursued, discovered by his eyes in
the ground, and the stolen fruit is squeezed out of him, thus causing the “sink places”

</p>
<p>(1) For the trail of ashes compare Barker, 51–54; Arcin, 478; Dayrell, 27; Nassau,

power if visited twice. The son follows and breaks the spell. The Kaffir “Iron John”
story of The Bird that made milk (Callaway, 99–104; Theal, 29–39), is the story of
a food-producing animal trapped by the father and let loose by the son.
</p>
<p>In Barker, Anansi, to punish men, gets the wisdom of the world sealed up in a jar

Anansi lets the jar fall and break.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story of “Brother Dead” is one of the best known of Jamaica stories. Trowbridge,
282, says Death is looked upon as Anansi’s brother. “Anansi fool ’em all; nobody can
fool Anansi, only Bredder Dead,” old Forbes said at the end of a trick story. Every
Jamaica collection includes a version. See Jekyll, 31–34; Milne-Home, 40–41; Trowbridge,
JAFL 9<span class="corr" id="xd32e14590" title="Source: ,">:</span> 286–287; Pamela Smith, 69–70; Wona, 73–77. For other references, compare Parsons,
Andros Island, 117–119 and note 2, page 117.
</p>
<p>The story turns upon Anansi’s stealing from Death’s provision field, as in <a href="#ch17b">17b</a>. All the versions except Wona’s version end with the episode of “refugees in the
roof,” as in number <a href="#ch5c">5c</a>; an episode related to the fruit-dropping or dust-blinding incident as a means of
getting rid of a strong enemy who is lying in wait for a weaker; as in numbers <a href="#ch13c">13c</a>, <a href="#ch23">23</a>.
</p>
<p>In Wona’s version, which has retained a European underworld coloring, Anansi passes
fields of fat cattle and comes finally to the city of Death. He greases the hinges
of the gate with the fat of the sheep he has killed out of Death’s flocks, and when
he flees, the gate opens for him. Nevertheless, the shadow of death jumps upon his
back. He asks various friends to take it off, and finally succeeds in throwing it
to earth; later he picks and eats callalu (Jamaica greens) from the spot where it
fell. This latter part of the story is the “Dry-head” episode of numbers <a href="#ch22">22</a> and <a href="#ch30">30</a>.
</p>
<p>In the ordinary Jamaica version, the comedy of getting the food, bringing the wife,
attempting Death’s destruction, take the place of the underworld detail. Another Maroon
version begins:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Anansi get a daughter he call Mat, an’ he go to a place where he was hunting an’ see
a man sitting down all day sharpening pegs. Anansi go an’ say “Morning, Brar Dead!”
Not a ’peak, only keep on work all a time. He go up on his lof’ have lots of dry meat,
an’ he tek as much an’ carry it down an’ bile his food. Anansi don’ walk where rope
is set against de water, walk a different pass.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>After Anansi has left his daughter with Dead, the story runs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Him daughter want water, say, “Brar Dead, want water.” Not a answer. Him follow de
pass an’ go down to whe’ de water deh; an’ him drop in Brar Dead’s rope an’ he catch
him. An’ Dead run down an’ tek him off de stick an’ lick him.—“Brar Dead, I’m yo’
wife! yo’ wife, Brar Dead! Don’ kill me! don’ kill me!” Don’ hear a word, not a word.
Kill him an’ cut him up an’ carry him put him up in lof’, mek fire under him, dry
him.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>In Trowbridge, Death is a loquacious planter and the story runs like any thieving
plot. In the Maroon version the figure of <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>“Brother Dead” corresponds with that of the “Piercer of Souls” or the “fisherman”
in American Indian stories of the trickster’s visit to the underworld, e.g. <span lang="fr">Relation de la Nouvelle France</span>, 1636, p. 106; Petitot, <span lang="fr">Traditions Indiennes des Déné Dinjé</span>, p. 33. The American Indian fisherman is spearing or angling for fish; the Jamaica
figure of Death is trapping game. Both tricksters make their way in by avoiding Death’s
trap.
</p>
<p>The incident of tying Death’s hair in order to burn him up corresponds to the hair-plaiting
in Callaway, 29, and Theal, 110, where the trickster sets fire to the hut and burns
up his host.
</p>
<p>Version (b) shows a simpler handling of similar incidents.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The second story of “Brother Dead” is mixed up with obeah beliefs and it is hard to
tell where the pattern ends and improvisation begins. Brother Dead, like the sorcerer,
evidently sends a shadow in the shape of a brindled pup to pursue and catch Anansi.
The song, meanwhile, plays a part in the conjuring. Words and tune are African. The
old Maroon who gave me the trap-setting picture of “Brar Dead” quoted in the note
to the last number, concluded as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“When he (Dead) ketch to a cross-path, tek him lance an’ see one little maugre dog
into a hole an’ dig him out an’ say to de puppy, ‘Ai! Brar, fo’ kitty a shall man

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The very popular Jamaica story of the “cowitch tree” is here combined with another
equally popular story. (1) Anansi wins a bet to fell a tree in a cowitch property
without scratching himself. (2) He loses the reward by being out-tricked by another
fellow whom he has himself hoped to dupe and who pretends that the cow has sunk into
the ground all but its tail.
</p>
<p>The story occurs in Pamela Smith, 75–77; Milne-Home, 89–90; and a confused version
in Jekyll, 29–30. Compare also number <a href="#ch52">52</a>.
</p>
<p>(1) The cowitch idea seems to be late Jamaican. In P. Smith, Anansi picks cocoa-nuts
in spite of ants and wasps and gets a cow as reward. In Milne-Home, he cuts down the
tree without <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>brushing off ants, and gets the king’s daughter. In number <a href="#ch52">52</a>, Toad succeeds in cutting down the tree the chips of which return magically to their
place, and wins the king’s daughter. Generally outside Jamaica, the reward is the
king’s daughter and the difficulty arises from stinging insects or from a useless
weapon.
</p>
<p>Compare Barker, 159–161; Tremearne FL 21: 353–354; Lenz, 31–32; Harris, Nights, 216–222
and note to 222; Jones, 17; Parsons, Sea Islands, 3.
</p>
<p>In Barker, the king promises an elephant to the man who can cut down a tree with a
wooden axe. Anansi conceals a steel axe and calls the watcher’s attention to various
animals at a distance while he uses it.
</p>
<p>In Harris, Wolf forbids his daughter to all wooers who slap at mosquitos. Rabbit wins
her by describing where his grandfather was speckled.
</p>
<p>In Jones, the king will give his daughter to Wolf or Rabbit, whichever will endure
the sand-fly longest without slapping it. Rabbit wins by describing the colors on
his father’s horse.
</p>
<p>In Tremearne, the task is to remove a heap of manure without either taking food or
spitting, and Spider conceals in his quiver the means to fulfil these needs unsuspected.
The story ends as in number <a href="#ch44">44</a>.
</p>
<p>In Lenz, the tree is to be chopped down with a single stroke by the one who wants
to marry the daughter.
</p>
<p>The test theme of the tree-chopping is familiar to European story. In Grimm, 79, the
boy has to hew down a tree with a blunt axe as one of the tasks set by the Water-nix;
see Bolte u. Polívka 2: 140–146. In Grimm 193, the Drummer has to hew down the tree
with an axe of lead and wedges and mallet of tin; see Bolte u. Polívka 3: 406–417.
The idea of stinging insects or plants as a test of self-control seems to be African
and may be suggested by such ceremonial initiations into manhood as are described
by Hollis, The Nandi, 54.
</p>
<p>In Jamaica, the reward of self-control is not a wife but a cow. This the winner desires
to eat entirely by himself. The “whole cow” theme so popular in Jamaica, occurs in
<a href="#ch19">19</a>, <a href="#ch22">22</a>, <a href="#ch30">30</a>, and in <a href="#ch6">6</a>, <a href="#ch7">7</a>, <a href="#ch11">11</a>, <a href="#ch21">21</a>, <a href="#ch23">23</a>, <a href="#ch24">24</a>, <a href="#ch25">25</a>, <a href="#ch34">34</a>, <a href="#ch39">39</a>, <a href="#ch132">132</a> of this collection, the story turns upon a trick to secure the whole of a common
food-supply.
</p>
<p>The Foolman episode is told by Milne-Home, 109–113, of Anansi’s wife and “Quanqua.”
</p>
<p>In P. Smith, the very popular “Dry-head” episode accounts for the loss of the cow,
as in numbers <a href="#ch22">22</a> and <a href="#ch30">30</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Barker, Anansi intends to get the cow to himself, but he loses it by the trick
of stealing the tied animal. See Parsons, FL 28: 411–413.
</p>
<p>For the trick of tails in the ground, compare Harris, Nights, 234–236; 247–258; Uncle

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The “Dry-head” episode is very popular in Jamaica. From Jekyll’s version, 48–49, I
have corrected my version 30c as Johnson gave it and made Dry-head, not Anansi, the
victim of the bag trick. Johnson was not a reliable informant. Other Jamaica versions
occur in Pamela Smith, 75–76, as the conclusion to the “cowitch” story, and in Wona,
44–50.
</p>
<p>The story falls into three parts. (1) Anansi pretends that he is about to die unless
he has the whole of a fat barrow to himself. (2) He carries it away into the woods
to eat and inadvertently picks up Dry-head, who devours the whole. (3) He invents
an expedient to get rid of Dry-head.
</p>
<p>Compare Surinam, JAFL 30: 244–246; Madagascar, Renel 2: 1–2; 57–59; Kaffir, Theal,
158–162; Upper Congo, Weeks FL 12: 82–83; West African, Tremearne, FL 22: 61–63; Barker,
66; Cronise and Ward, 287–290; Rattray, 2: 106–122.
</p>
<p>(1) Rattray’s Hausa version is identical with the Jamaican. The Surinam story lacks
the Dry-head ending. In the Madagascar and Congo stories, the trick turns upon pretending
that a spirit warns the wife against poison if she partakes of her husband’s food.
In Theal, Kenkebe visits his father-in-law in time of famine, is feasted on an ox
and given bags of corn, which he conceals. Compare numbers <a href="#ch21c">21c</a>, <a href="#ch23">23</a>, <a href="#ch24">24</a>, <a href="#ch25">25</a>, and <a href="#ch29">29</a>.
</p>
<p>(2) A Masai story (Hollis, 15) tells of two brothers who are given a bullock to slaughter.
They carry it to “a place where there was no man or animal, or bird, or insect, or
anything living,” and a devil puts them to much inconvenience. The pursuit of Anansi
by the shadow of Death, in the Wona version of 27, has already been referred to in
the Dry-head episode. In Barker, 81–84, the stolen flour-producing stone which Anansi
is carrying off, sticks to his head and grinds him to pieces, as referred to in the
note to number <a href="#ch22">22</a>.
</p>
<p>In Theal, Kenkebe’s wife and son hide themselves behind the rock which conceals his
secret store, and push over a stone which pursues him as far as his own house.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Barker, 66, the king gives to the greedy man a box so enchanted that it can never
be put down.
</p>
<p>In Sac and Fox Indian tales, JAFL 15: 177, the monster-killing twins bring home a
rock which sticks upon their backs until they carry it to its place again.
</p>
<p>In the Ojibway Nanabushu cycle, Jones, Pub. Eth. Soc. 1: 117–127, Nanabushu is cooking
a deer. The branches of the tree creak and he gets up to grease them and is caught
and hung there. Meanwhile, the wolves come and eat up the deer. He finally escapes,
discovers that the brains of the deer are still left in the deer-skull, transforms
himself into a snake and crawls into the head. Turning too quickly back into human
shape, he gets caught with the skull fast to his head and has to carry it about with
him until he manages to break it against a rock.
</p>
<p>(3) The regular Jamaica conclusion of the Dry-head episode seems to be the Aesopic
one in which a bird carries him in air and drops him, not against a rock but, in Jekyll,
“in the deepest part of the woods;” in version (c), “in a sea-ball.” In another version
not printed here, Anansi takes in an old man because he has some food with him; but
when the food gives out, the man “become a Dry-head on him,” and Anansi puts him off
on Tacoomah, who leaves him by the sea so that a wave comes up and drowns him. In
version (a) Anansi burns him up. Version (b) is a witticism in the same class as “Dry-head
and the Barber” in this collection.
</p>
<p>In Pamela Smith’s version, Anansi shoots the bird who is doing him the favor of carrying
off Dry-head. See note to number <a href="#ch70">70</a> and compare P. Smith, 59–64, in which Tiger, pursued by the “Nyams,” begs one animal
after another to hide him, but always lets his presence be known. Finally, when Goat
kills the “Nyams,” he eats Goat with the “Nyams.”
</p>
<p>In Dorsey, The Pawnee, 126, and Traditions of the Arikara, 146–148, Coyote, pursued
by a Rolling Stone, takes refuge with the Bull-bats and is defended by them. In the
Pawnee version, he later insults his rescuers.

<p>The story depends upon the idea that it is unlucky to reveal to others a marvel one
has seen oneself, or to repeat certain taboo words. A lad in the Santa Cruz mountains
explained the taboo by saying that Anansi had “six” legs. Another said that Anansi’s
mother’s name was “Six.” So in Pamela Smith (JAFL 9: 278), the Queen’s name is “Five.”

<p class="first">The story of Tumble-bug’s revenge is even more common than the last number. In Wona,
51–55, Tumble-bug is carrying butter and Anansi only lard. Anansi proposes that they
put their loads together, sees that Tumble-bug’s is at the bottom, and makes the ruling
in order that he may get the butter and Tumble-bug the lard. Compare number 46 and

<p>The revenge story is recent. In Wona, Tumble-bug suffers further at Anansi’s hands.

<p>In Tremearne, FL 21: 213–214, Tortoise and Spider have a bull in common; Tortoise

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Parkes’s version, the substitution of the human for the fish victim not only spoils
the wit of the story but obscures its relation to the story of Anansi’s visit to fish-country
as it appears in number 39. The identity of the two is proved by the structure of
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>story, which falls into two parts. (1) Anansi, pretending to cure a sick relative,
eats her instead. (2) The mule offers to avenge her and plays dead outside Anansi’s
door; when he attempts to make use of her for food, she drags him into the water and
drowns him, as in number <a href="#ch6">6</a>.
</p>
<p>For (1) compare Cronise and Ward, 226–230, where Rabbit pretends to cure Leopard’s
children and eats them up; Nassau, 125–126, where Tortoise pretends to bring children
out of Crocodile’s hundred eggs, and eats them all.
</p>
<p>(2) In Parsons’s Portuguese negro story, JAFL 30: 231–235, Lob escapes from the island
where the indignant birds have abandoned him, by bribing Horse-fish to carry him across.
He promises to pay her well, but abandons the horse-fish as soon as he touches shore.
She remains weeping on the shore. Lob thinks her dead and starts to cut her up. She
drags him into the sea and drowns him. There are small touches in the story which
prove its identity with the Jamaica version. When Lob’s wife weeps, Lob says, “She
is just playing with me, she is not going to do anything.” In Parkes’s story, Anansi
says to the mule who is dragging him into the sea, “A little fun me mak wid you, no
mean i’.” In both Jamaica versions, Mule turns Anansi over to the vengeance of the
fishes; in the Portuguese, he is drowned.
</p>
<p>In Jekyll, 135–137, an old lady meddles with a jar she has been told not to touch
and which, as soon as she gets her hand in, drags her to the sea and drowns her.
</p>
<p>In Jekyll, 125, “Cousin Sea-mahmy” makes his son Tarpon carry Anansi to shore, and
Anansi gets him into the pot by the trick of taking turns weighing each other, as
in number 16.
</p>
<p>In Pamela Smith, 44–46, Anansi eats the sick mother under pretence of cure, and bribes
Dog to carry him across the river, but there is no vengeance; Dog himself is swallowed
by Crocodile.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Jekyll, 129–131, and Milne-Home, 35–39, have excellent versions of this very popular
Jamaica story, which, in its full form, is made up of four episodes. (1) The birds
take Anansi across the water to their feeding-place where<span class="corr" id="xd32e14941" title="Source: ;">,</span> because of his bad behavior, they abandon him. (2) Anansi visits Fish and claims
relationship. Fish tests him with a cup of hot pop, which he cools in the sun under
pretence of heating it hotter. (3) He is lodged for the night with a box of eggs,
all of which he eats but one; and when called upon to count the eggs, brings Fish
the same one every time, <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>after wiping off the mark. (4) Fish sends her children to row him home. He fools them
out of heeding her call when she discovers the loss of the eggs. Once on shore, he
fries and eats the children.
</p>
<p>Compare Tremearne, 265–266; Head-hunters, 324–326; Rattray, 2: 88–104; Parsons, Portuguese
negroes, JAFL 30: 231–235; Andros Island, 2–3.
</p>
<p>(1) The episode of the birds’ feeding-place is to be compared with that of Fire-fly
and the egg-hunt, number <a href="#ch7">7</a>, and with the visit “inside the cow,” number <a href="#ch22">22</a>. In the Portuguese version, the birds take Lob to a dance and he sings insulting
songs because there is no feast.
</p>
<p>(2) The test of relationship occurs in Jekyll and in Tremearne, Head-hunters. It belongs
to the same class of boasts as those of the Clever Tailor in Grimm 20 and 183.
</p>
<p>(3) In Milne-Home, the scorpion trick is employed to guard the eggs, as in number
<a href="#ch7">7</a>, and Anansi complains of “fleas” biting him. The episode is lacking in Jekyll.
</p>
<p>In Tremearne, Head-hunters, when Spider breaks the egg-shells, the children cry out
to know what is the matter and Spider says he is hiccoughing.
</p>
<p>The egg-counting trick generally occurs in a different connection. The trickster visits
Tiger’s house, eats all the cubs but one, and counts that one many times. Compare
Callaway, 24–27; MacDonald 1: 55–56; Theal 111; Jacottet, 40–45; Rattray, Chinyanje,
137–138; Harris, Nights, 346–348.
</p>
<p>(4) In Jekyll, Anansi visits “Sea-mahmy,” who is a mermaid, and her son, “Trapong,”
or tarpon, takes him home. In Milne-Home, “Alligator” is host; a “boatman” the ferryman.
Lob gets “aunt” sea-horse to carry him to shore. In my Jamaica versions, the sons
are the ferrymen and are generally cooked and eaten at the other end. The misinterpreted
call occurs in all Jamaica versions and in Tremearne, Head-hunters. In the Lob story,
Lob mutters an insult; when asked to repeat his words, he declares that he has merely
praised the sea-horse’s swimming; compare Parsons, Sea Islands, 54–56. For the fate
of the ferryman, see also note to number <a href="#ch38">38</a> and compare Anansi’s treatment of Rat in the note to number <a href="#ch7">7</a>.

<p class="first">This fragmentary story belongs, with the Man-crow story of number 90, to a much longer
African story which relates the adventures of a child-hero whose father, dying, leaves
instructions that the child’s will shall never be crossed. Incidents succeed one another
of inhuman ingratitude and of intrepid heroism, based on the possession of magical
powers, until the boy finally kills a bird-monster and performs other remarkable exploits.

<p>Compare Tremearne, How Auta killed Dodo, 408–412; Zeltner, <span lang="fr">Histoire de Kama</span>, 47–62.
</p>
<p>“Harry” in this story is the counterpart of the older sister who acts as Kama’s mentor
in Zeltner’s version, and of “Barra” in Tremearne. The four episodes are common to
this and the Kama story,—the stolen breakfast, the insult to the sheltering old woman,
and the two episodes of the breaking of the rescuing eagle’s wing, followed immediately
by the abuse of the friendly tortoise. In Zeltner, the tortoise has restored the children
to life. The common-place incidents of the Jamaica version are in curious contrast
with the rich and varied phantasmagoria of the Senegambian tale.

of the ladies. He comes out when his mother calls him. He is finally lured out and
caught in the meshes of his lover’s hair.
</p>
<p>In Grimm 8, Bolte u. Polívka 1: 69–70, a little girl is forced by her brothers to
go out and cut peat with a dull knife. Her elf-lover stretches out a sharp knife to
her from the hill where he lives and tells her to call him by striking on the stone.
The brothers wonder how she can cut the peat, and spy upon her. They strike the stone,
take the knife and cut off the elf’s hand, who thereafter disappears.

<p class="first">This nursery tale was commonly recited to me by women, and a great many versions differed
only in trifling respects from the pattern employed in the oldest Jamaica version
on record, Lewis, 255–259.
</p>
<p>Here the girl breaks a jug and is sent to get a new one. Three old women appear to
her one after another, the last of them headless, to test her courtesy. The cat appears,
the rice is cooking. The eggs to be selected are the “silent” ones out of a number
of fine large ones that cry “take me.” Out of the first egg comes the jug after which
she has been sent; the other two make her fortune.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>P. Smith’s version, 31–34, has more direct Frau Holle incidents. The good girl fulfils
as she advances the requests of the grass, ping-wing and bramble, the fruit-tree and
the cow. When the old woman sends her to draw water with a basket, Turtle tells her
to put a plantain-leaf inside. She selects a little ugly calabash. When she is pursued
by “axe-men” (as in number <a href="#ch82">82</a>), the things she has been kind to befriend her, as in Wona’s version of Brother Dead.
</p>
<p>In a manuscript version in the collection of Mrs. W.&nbsp;E. Wilson (Wona), Yuckie and
Jubba are the two daughters. Yuckie has a present of a string of amber beads. She
puts them about her neck and says “bad dey behind you, good dey before you,” but this
only in dream. She loses the beads in the river and is turned out of the house. On
her way, she sees and greets kindly a foot and a hand, and scratches the back of an
ugly old woman, without complaining of the insects which sting her. The pot of rice,
the cat, and the eggs are as above. The fine eggs say “Tek me no,” the dirty ones,
“No tek me.” Compare FLJ (SA) 1; 111–116, where the girls pretend to throw their beads
into the water and thus deceive one girl into doing so, who has then to go down to
the home of the water monster to get them back.
</p>
<p>The variants from Andros Island, Parsons, 17–26, show no such uniformity. They are
sometimes confused with the pumpkin story of Parsons, 26–27, and Milne-Home, 84–88,
in which the choice of pumpkins is like that of the eggs in this story.
</p>
<p>The theme is very common in African collections. Compare MacDonald 1:298–301; Junod,
191–192; 237–242; Torrend, 75–80; Tremearne, 307–314; 401–407; Barker, 89–94; Nassau,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is one of the longest stories I heard in Jamaica. The leading Maroon story-teller
recited it to me in full audience, and I heard it repeated by another Maroon in much
less detail. Numbers <a href="#ch83">83</a>, <a href="#ch84">84</a> and <a href="#ch89">89</a> have points of likeness to it.
</p>
<p>It has five parts. (1) Two brothers are out penning cattle and one, going for fire,
surprises a witch in the act of feeding her family, which she carries about in her
own body. (2) The witch, bent on revenge, follows them home and proposes, as a test
for a husband, knocking a calabash from her head with a missile; the boy throws a
frail missile and succeeds. (3) At night, the witch <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>sharpens her razor to kill him, but each time she approaches, one of his dogs warns
him. (4) The boy departs with his bride, leaving his dogs chained, but he places a
pot in the middle of the floor and warns his mother when the liquid in the pot begins
to boil to loosen the dogs to his rescue. (5) He climbs a tree to escape the witch.
She produces axes and axe-men by tapping her body and proceeds to chop the tree, which
he restores magically until his dogs rush in and tear up the witch.
</p>
<p>Compare Barker, 123–128; Callaway, 51–54; Chatelain, 103–110; Jacottet, 58; Renel
1:86–93; Theal, 46; Tremearne, 432–441; Zeltner, 61; FLJ (SA) 1:13–17; 21–25; Lenz,
15–17; Edwards, 72; Harris, Friends, 91–100; Parsons, Andros Island, 66–70; Sea Islands,
80–88; JAFL 30:189–190; JAFL 25:259; 32:399–400.
</p>
<p>(1) “Possessing the fire” is a sign of magic power, according to Junod, 157, note.
In Edwards, “De big worrum” has fire. A father sends two sons in turn to fetch it,
but as they reach after the fire the worm swallows them. The father goes with a lance
that glistens, is swallowed, cuts open the worm and rescues all the people the worm
has swallowed. In Renel, 88, the pursuing monster swallows people alive. Compare Tremearne,
and Parsons, Andros Island, 67, 68.
</p>
<p>In Tremearne, a hunter sees a witch knocking herself and feeding monsters all over
her body. In Jacottet, an axe chops out of the body of the witch the cows which are
the cause of the two brothers’ quarrel.
</p>
<p>(2) In Barker, the episode of the calabash is attached to the story of the hunter,
told in number <a href="#ch84">84</a>. The elephant whose tail he has cut off turns into a lady and goes to find her mutilator.
She proposes a test similar to the test in this story. In Tremearne, the witch proposes
the test, as in this story, because the hunter has seen more than he should.
</p>
<p>(3) For this episode see note to number <a href="#ch83">83</a> and references. In Tremearne, the boy’s father insists upon the son’s taking a horse,
a sword, and gourds. When the witch sharpens her teeth to eat the boy, the horse wakens
him. In Parsons, Andros Island, 68, the boy escapes the witch’s razor by turning into
a bucket of water.
</p>
<p>(4) It is not clear how this episode of the life token got attached to the story.
I do not find it in African versions. That it is fairly constant is shown in Parsons,
66, 67, 69. In the more common form of the story of the Two Brothers, with which this
story has some elements in common, the life-token often takes the form of <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>a knife stuck in a tree; see number 104. In Tremearne, 298, the treed husband has
carried his flute, with which he warns his wife to loosen his dogs very much in the
manner of Roland at Roncevalle. In Jekyll, 35, the water in a white saucer set in
the sun turns to blood, but this is a Blue-beard story.
</p>
<p>(5) Climbing a tree to escape an enemy is one of the commonest episodes in African
flight stories. See number 89. Here it occurs combined with the axe-chopping contest
and the rescue by dogs, who rush in at the end and tear the pursuer to pieces. In
Tremearne, the woman transforms herself in various ways before the dogs succeed in
killing her. They then devour every drop of her blood. In number <a href="#ch104">104</a>, the dogs are restrained from taking part in the fight with the witch by being chained
by the witch’s hair. This episode is also of frequent occurrence in American Indian
lore. See Parsons, <span lang="de">Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</span> 54:1–29 (1922).
</p>
<p>In some cases, e.g. in Theal, Zeltner, Harris, 85–90, and in FLJ (SA), the tree-cutting
episode occurs independently of the rescuing dogs.

<p>The point of the story is voiced in Nassau, 15; “If you find a friend, it is not well

the last, which is “dat t’ing wey turn fas’ fas’ pon top de wattah.” In Tremearne,
FL 22, he starts to say the word for “ring” (zoba) gets as far as “zop” and is interrupted.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides the last number, three other types of monster marriage stories are common
in Jamaica, all of which, though versions overlap or vary, follow a fairly fixed pattern.
They may be distinguished as the Snake husband, the Devil husband, and the Bull husband.
</p>
<p>The Snake husband story is very common. Besides the half dozen here set down of the
many versions offered me, seven Jamaica stories already collected follow the general
pattern with more or less exactness. See Lewis, 291–296, Sarah Wintun; Milne Home,
54–55, The Sneake; 46–50, De Sneake an’ de King’s Darter; Bates, JAFL 9:121, The Yalla
Snake; Jekyll, 26, The Three Sisters; 102–104, Yellow Snake; 65, Tacoma and the old
Witch Girl.
</p>
<p>The story has three parts. (1) A difficult young lady refuses all suitors, but falls
in love with a Snake dressed as a handsome man. (2) He has borrowed his fine parts
and on the journey home drops them one by one, becomes a Snake, and takes her to his
home. (3) Her brothers hear her song of distress and rescue her just as the Snake
is about to swallow her. These elements are fairly constant in modern Jamaica versions.
</p>
<p>(1) “The pick and choose” idea occurs in Bates’s, all Jekyll’s and all my versions,
although the idea that fine clothes do not make the man is also emphasized.
</p>
<p>For the “pick and choose” motive, compare Zeltner, 85, where the girl refuses to marry
anyone but “<span lang="fr">un homme n’avant aucune ouverture</span>;” Nassau, 68, where she will have no man with “even a little bit of a blotch on his
skin;” Tremearne, FL 22:346, where he must have “not one blemish;” and Christensen,
10, where the girl refuses to marry anyone with a scratch on his back. In none of
these cases does the husband take the form of a Snake. Compare also Jacottet, 126–159,
where are recorded five snake-husband stories, four of which are enchanted beast stories
(two of the “Beauty and the Beast” type and two of the “Yonec” type), and the fifth
is a good and bad-mannered girl story, none of which use the “pick and choose” motive.
</p>
<p>(2) The borrowed clothes appear in both Milne-Home’s versions, in Bates’s, in two
of Jekyll’s and in two of mine. In Milne-Home, <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>the story ends with the dropping of the clothes; in Jekyll and in two of mine, the
monster carries her to his den or “stone-hole.”
</p>
<p>The clothes-borrowing idea occurs in Cronise and Ward, 178–186, where “half-man” borrows
his other half; in Dayrell, 39; Fortier, 71; Hollis, Masai, 201–202; Parsons, Andros
Island, 48 iv, 49 v, 50 i, 53 iv, and in Sea Islands, 46.
</p>
<p>(3) In Jekyll, 102, and all my versions, the <span class="corr" id="xd32e15891" title="Source: gir’s">girl’s</span> song for help and the answering swallowing song furnish the main interest of the
story; and the rescue by the brothers follows in Jekyll and in my two versions. In
my third version, the Snake swallows the girl while her parents are sleeping. In Lewis’s
much earlier story, a jealous sorceress gives her step-daughter over to a great black
dog named Tiger, who takes her away to his den. She sings until her hunter brothers
hear her song, rush in and rescue her.
</p>
<p>In Renel 1:275–277, a girl weds a beast in disguise, because of his handsome clothes,
is carried away to his hole, and finally attracts her mother’s ears by her song of
lamentation. In other African stories of monster marriages, the song is entrusted
to a bird messenger.
</p>
<p>For the rescue, see Jekyll’s Bluebeard story, 35–37; Bleek, 61–64; Christensen, 10–14;
and numbers 83 and 86.
</p>
<p>Evidently the story has become fixed in Jamaica out of a number of different elements
and does not depend upon a common source. The lesson to the over-fastidious girl,
ridicule of her fear of the ordeal of marriage, and the old setting of the rescue
by hunter-brothers, are drawn together into a coherent story. It is the song that
makes the story popular.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The flight from a Devil husband has also taken on a fixed form in Jamaica in contrast
to the number of variants related on Andros Island and the much more complex versions
known in Africa. It is possible that this is true only for the localities visited.
</p>
<p>The story has three parts. (1) A girl marries a handsome man against her little brother’s
warning. (2) The man, who is usually the devil, carries her home, accompanied in secret
by the brother, locks her up, and sets a cock to watch her. (3) An old woman befriends
her, they feed the cock with various grains and finally escape over the river in the
Devil’s magic boat, pursued by the Devil.
</p>
<p>Jekyll, 148–151, The Devil and the Princess, has a version of this story.
</p>
<p>Compare Zeltner, 85–90; Nassau, 68–76; Fortier, 68–75; <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>Jones, 82–88; Chatelain, 99–101; Barker, 97–101; Jacottet, 160–166; Callaway, 78–85;
Christensen, 10–14; Tremearne, FL 22: 346–348; Dayrell, 38–41; 98–103; Parsons, Andros
Island, 49–54; Sea Islands, 45–49; JAFL 30: 181–183; JAFL 12: 126–130; and see references
to numbers <a href="#ch83">83</a> and <a href="#ch85">85</a>.
</p>
<p>(1) In the Snake marriage, number 85, there is no rejected warning, but the hunter-brothers
come to the rescue. In numbers <a href="#ch83">83</a> and <a href="#ch87">87</a>, it is the despised little brother who effects the escape.
</p>
<p>(2) In Jacottet, a girl is carried away to the land of the half-bodied people and
guarded by horns that cry out. They are silenced by pouring in hot water and stuffing
them with stones. In Barker, the dragon who carries away Anansi and his son sets a
white cock to warn him if they try to escape. In Christensen, a fly guards the girl
and Tiger comes running at its call. In Fortier and JAFL 12: 128, roosters guard the
girl. In Callaway, an old woman warns the Pigeons when the <span class="corr" id="xd32e15931" title="Source: girls escape">girl escapes</span>.
</p>
<p>(3) The only version of the flight theme which I found developed in Jamaica is that
of the evasion of the guardian cock by feeding him enough corn so that the girl can
get across the river before the cock summons the husband.
</p>
<p>In some flight stories, it is the pursuing monster himself who is silenced with the
corn-throwing. In Nassau, the fleeing girl throws out three gourdfuls of seed which
the Leopard stops to pick up. In Chatelain, the woman throws out calabashes of seed
to the pursuing cannibal. Compare Renel 1: 38–40; 2: 262–263; Ferrand, 119–122.
</p>
<p>The appearance of both the kindly maid-servant and the helpful brother in the Jamaica
versions is irrelevant. The immense popularity of the theme of the despised little
brother probably makes his appearance an inthrust. In Zeltner, Nassau and Jones, a
friendly horse accompanies the bride. In JAFL 12: 126–130, a friendly ox belonging
to the husband carries the bride. So also in Parsons, Andros Island, 51–52 ii, and
in JAFL 30: 181, the friendly animal is taken from the husband’s fields.
</p>
<p>In Zeltner and Jones, the horse warns its mistress; in Dayrell the old mother sends
her home because the girl is kind to her; in Fortier, because she is sorry for her;
in JAFL 12, the old wife sends her away because she is jealous. In Dayrell, 101, a
skull to which she has been kind acts the part of helper.
</p>
<p>In Zeltner, Nassau, Fortier, Jones and Parsons, Andros Island, 52–54 iii, iv, and
Sea Islands, the flight develops into an obstacle race. In Parsons, 50–51, and Tremearne,
the fugitives escape by <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>transformation. In Callaway, the sea divides; in Fortier, the Crocodile carries the
girl over and drowns her pursuer. Riddling questions are to be answered in JAFL 12;
Parsons, Andros Island, 52 iii; Sea Islands, 46; JAFL 30; see Jekyll, 26–28. A secret
door gives a Blue-beard turn to the versions of Jones, Fortier, and Parsons, Andros
Island, 44–45, and Sea Islands, 47–49; see Jekyll, 35–37.
</p>
<p>The Jamaica version is on the whole bare of incident. Interest centers in the imitative
songs of swallowing, of running, and in the boat-call, to the exclusion of any further
development of the flight theme.

her to go out by day and she is taken by the river, returns to suckle her child, and

a bottle of water and a bottle of rum. When he calls “Geshawnee,” the bull says, “Since
I have been in this place, I never heard anyone call my name.” The boy stays up the
tree into which he has climbed by the formula, “Bear up, me good tree, bear up! I
have often seen me father fell a green tree and leave a dry one.”
</p>
<p>In a Mandeville version by John Macfarlane, the boy’s name is “Simon Tootoos,” the
bull’s “Garshanee.” The woman makes him a pudding and he takes six eggs each of hen,
turkey and bird. He opens three gates with song, and the giant appears in the form
of a bull. He climbs a cotton-wood tree. When the bull throws arrows at him he says,
“I see me father take his little finger and catch longer arrows than those!” He catches
twelve, with which he pelts the bull in return.
</p>
<p>Neither of these versions ends with the false claim.
</p>
<p>In another Mandeville version given by a lad, Clarence Tathum, the slayer of the mother
is a giant named “Tako-rimo.” The son takes a yard of tobacco and a pone. With the
tobacco, he bribes the watchman to give him information about the giant and an iron-crow-bar.
He goes inside and sees a servant lousing the giant’s head. “Massa, der is someone
calling you name,” says the servant. “Who would calling my name so uncommon?” answers
the giant. The giant flings a sword, which the boy catches and himself flings the
crowbar and kills the giant. The story goes on to tell how the boy is imprisoned by
the brother, “Giant Despair,” and escapes exactly as in the tale of “Jack the Giant-Killer,”
while the giant falls into a trench and is killed.
</p>
<p>In Stephen Johnson’s version from Claremont, a huge animal by the name of “Grandezee”
kills the mother but spares the child. To escape the beast, the boy climbs a tree
and sings, “Bear up, me good tree, for I often see me father get down tall trees and
ketch them up again!” He throws three pegs and pegs down Grandezee and takes out the
golden tongue and teeth. The false claim follows.
</p>
<p>In a version from Brownstown by Emanuel Johnson, “Geshawnee was a kind of witch t’ing
live into de river.” He has seven heads. Sammy cuts seven lances, climbs a tree and
calls his name. He says, ‘From day I’m born, never see a big man call me name, much
more a little boy!’ He knocks his side and brings out axe-men, rain and cattle, which
attack the tree in vain. Sammy sings, “Bear up, me good tree, bear up. I oftentimes
see me father cow <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>haul down a tree an’ me father say, ‘Bear up, me good tree, bear up,’ an’ that tree
bear up.” Sammy kills the monster. The story of the false claim follows.
</p>
<p>In Parsons’s fragment, 145–146, the name is Kramytadanta. The boy takes a bottle of
water and a loaf and sings from the tree.
</p>
<p>Seven episodes regularly belong to the story. (1) A bull (or monster) kills a woman
whose new-born son is saved and brought up by a woman-friend or relative. (2) The
boys at school mock at him because he has no father, and he learns the story of his
parentage. (3) He takes certain objects for slaying the monster. (4) He sings a name-song
as challenge. (5) He climbs a tree which resists attack. (6) He slays the beast by
hurling missiles from the tree. (7) Anansi claims the deed.
</p>
<p>Compare Zeltner’s stories of Soundita, 1–6, and Kama, 54–61; Renel 1:82–85; 117–118;
Tremearne, 408–412; Lenz, 22; Fortier, 11–13; Harris, Friends, 86–89; Boas, Notes,
JAFL 25:258.
</p>
<p>(1) In the less sophisticated versions, the bull kicks the child from the “breeding”
woman.
</p>
<p>(2) See Burton’s Arabian Nights Tales (Burton Club, 1885) 1:231. The mocking incident
is common in Maori tales.
</p>
<p>(3) In Zeltner’s “Soundita” story, the contest with a witch turned buffalo is carried
on with three magic eggs and three magic arrows. In Fortier, the boy fights the bull
with flap-jacks. The arrows suggest the weapons used in the fight of Sir Percival
with the Red Knight in the English romance version. See also number 79, 80, 82.
</p>
<p>(4) By comparing this bull version with Harris, Friends, 86–89, and Fortier, 11–13,
it is clear that the North American version contained the two episodes, that of exposing
the bull husband by means of a song, as in number <a href="#ch87">87</a>, and that of the challenge to conflict which completes number <a href="#ch89">89</a> in Jamaica. In Harris, the word used for the bull transformation is “Ballybaloo-bill,”
which is very close to my “Ballinder bull.” The more common name in Jamaica is “Geshawnee,”
as in P. Smith’s version and Johnson’s song. But in Johnson’s song, as in Harris,
the boy is named Sammy and his small size emphasized. In the Harris-Fortier version,
one episode is used to motivate the other. The first episode explains the rather mysterious
use of the song in the Ballinder Bull story and in number <a href="#ch88">88</a>, where the bull seems surprised that anyone knows enough to challenge him by name
and where the knowledge itself seems bound up with his defeat. In Jekyll’s version
of number <a href="#ch88">88</a>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>when the son challenges the father by name a cow calls, “Master, master, I hear some
one calling your name.” The bull answers, “No, no, not a man can call my name!” At
some stage in transmission a fatal name motive must have dropped out and a magic song
taken its place.
</p>
<p>This comparison with Harris and Fortier merely proves a relation with the Jamaica
story. It by no means explains the original source of the American version, or its
exact relation to the other bull stories collected; namely, numbers <a href="#ch84">84</a> and <a href="#ch88">88</a>. Zeltner’s story of Soundita, 3–5, has perhaps more elements in common with the Harris-Fortier
story than any other African parallel, and further analysis may decide whether the
complex Senegambian story is in the direct line or merely has gathered episodes from
a common source.

story follows this order: (1) Gold-producing animal, (2) Life-giving staff, (3) Ear
cut off, the life-giving staff taking the place of the killing hot bath. In a Jamaica
version from Richard Morgan, the killing hot bath is followed by the story of carting
the mother about as if she were alive and extracting hush money from her pretended
murderers, as in number 135 (episode G” in Bolte u. Polívka’s analysis of Grimm 61).

<p class="first">The story is common in Jamaica. See Jekyll, 98–99. It was told me as a “speak-acting”
story, but as I could get no other of exactly the same character, I do not know how
common it used to be to present a Nansi story in this way. The Nansi story is now
given in the form of a dramatic monologue or rehearsed simply as a tale.
</p>
<p>For the story of “The Fifer,” six actors were required, one to represent the boy,
one the father, and four others the “wild beasts.” “Anansi,” “Dry-head,” “Tacoomah”
and “Tiger” were the “beasts.” Roe said that “the one who takes the son’s part tells
the story.” The dramatization went on much like a school exercise performed by grown
men, with improvised action and (probably) extemporized dialogue. It ended in a dance
in which all six joined.
</p>
<p>Compare Tremearne, 301; Harris, Nights, 370–373; Edwards, 87–88; Parsons, Andros Island,
137–138.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>The story seems to be drawn from such prohibitions against whistling at night or whistling
more than twice when walking at night or through a haunted forest as are quoted by
Sebillot, <span lang="fr">Le Folk-lore de France</span> 1: 159, 283. He tells a Breton story of a lad who forgot the prohibition and found
himself mocked and followed by the Devil, who bore him off just as he had reached

They are composed of scraps of song or whole scenes from well-known Nansi stories,
together with game-songs, imitations of animal sounds, and “rhyming,” strung together
much like our own musical medleys—the last line of one suggesting the first of the
next. In this example, story-songs from numbers <a href="#ch97">97</a> and <a href="#ch86">86</a> are followed by a game dialogue; next by some animal imitations; last, by a specimen
of Jamaica “rhyming.” Other examples of this kind of improvised “rhyming” are:

taken from a popular game in which one player represents the cat, another the rat;
all the others form a line with clasped hands, and Puss tries to catch Rat through
the line, while all sing the song. The bull’s song belongs to number <a href="#ch88">88</a> or <a href="#ch89">89</a>. Anansi’s fifing is possibly taken from <a href="#ch139">139</a>.

<p>Tremearne, 28, says that the imitation of animal cries is a favorite device in African

<h3 class="main">Witticisms.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I &amp; II. These old-fashioned slave stories are from old Vassel Edwards at Retirement,
in the Cock-Pit country. They belong to the “nager-trick” stories quoted by Lewis.
</p>
<p>III. The Congo negro is said to be duller-witted than negroes from the Gold Coast.
To call a man a “Congo” is hence a term of ridicule.
</p>
<p>IV. This witticism is common. In one version, the man was said to be “walking in Kingston.”
Mrs. Elizabeth Hilton gave me a version she learned from Henry Roe, school-master
at Retirement, which bears the marks of having been put together by some literary
entertainer.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Massa Peter was a funny sort of a buckra massa. He was “mustafenia” (white by law).
Massa Peter an’ me, we go to school together. We were readin’ in a ‘pellin’ (book)
an’ we were doin’ jumba fraction sum.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd32e16933" title="Not in source">“</span>From the day me leave school me never see Marse Peter any more till one day we buck
up. A glad to see him till a couldn’t glad any more. Marse Peter went a tell me somet’ing,
a laugh till me belly nearly pop.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd32e16936" title="Not in source">“</span>Marse Peter was the sort of boy used to go out after hours. Him ma tell him if him
(she) been dead before him, she will show him token (frighten him). <span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>But Marse Peter never will believe her. One night, Marse Peter go out. When him coming
back, he catch right at the cross-road where dem Taylor boy used to sit down a day-time,
an’ smell somet’ing funny, but he never know wha’. He been ’fraid, but afterward he
no ’fraid again. An’ see one man come wid litt’e fire. He say, ‘I beg you a light,
sah!’ The man give him a light. The man has some teeth a his mouth, they long like
a Jack-ass a laugh a sun-hot. Marse Peter pass the man. He meet up another man. He
say, ‘Look here, me frien’, I meet a man jus’ roun’ the turning, have teeth long like
a Jack-ass a laugh a sun-hot.’ The man said, ‘Teeth like these do they long?’ Marse
Peter run an’ he run an’ never stop runnin’ till he meet up a mother bed. From that,
Marse Peter never go af’er no girl again. Marse Peter behave a good buckra massa af’er
this.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>V. The witticism is used in a good many connections. In one story, a man finds a boy
by the roadside and takes him home. When he asks the boy to blow the fire, the duppy
says, “Me kyant blow de fire, for me dead long time an’ dirt eat out all me teet’.”
The man beats him and he runs away crying, “Lor! me dead two time.” In another version,
“Rolling Calf” takes possession of a house. While he is asleep, the owner makes an
iron fork red hot and catches him about the neck.
</p>
<p>VI. See number <a href="#ch145">145</a>.
</p>
<p>VIII. Compare Cundall, FL 15:91, where the “Rolling Calf,” afraid of the moon, tumbles
over into the stream and sprains his foot. He says, “A don’t mind the wet, a wet,
but the ’prain a ’prain me foot’.”
</p>
<p>X. In Tremearne, FL 22:222–223, Lizard and Mouse both court a woman. Mouse tells her
that Lizard is blind, can’t see at night; Cock tells her that Rat is a thief, can’t
be seen in the market.
</p>
<p>In Koelle, 174–177, Toad and Rat have a wager to see if one can do what the other
cannot. Toad passes a crowd with a whole skin; Rat is pursued with sticks and stones.
</p>
<p>XI. See number <a href="#ch48">48</a>.
</p>
<p>XII. From Alexander Archibald, near Mandeville.
</p>
<p>XIII. From Mrs. Matilda Hall, Harmony Hall. See number <a href="#ch4">4</a>.
</p>
<p>XVI. This and the next two witticisms were written out by some young lads in Bethlehem,
Santa Cruz Mountains.

it when he was a little boy. Hauling lumber was in old days accompanied by song. The

claim to magical powers which he does not possess.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. <i>Alexander</i>, Emily, aged 15. She came to my room in the evening after her work was done at the
hotel and recited to me more than twenty stories which she had from her father, who
was a native of Mandeville, and with which she was in the habit of entertaining the
other young people employed at the hotel.

<p>6. <i>Barrett</i>, George, aged 60 or over. He visited me at Harmony Hall with a group of men from

with a fine sense of fair play.

but recited them in a slovenly way, without wit or point.
</p>
<p class="infoRef">See <a href="#ch117">117</a>.
</p>
<p>11. <i>Christie</i>, Samuel, over 60. He was one of the group at Steeretown, near St. Ann’s Bay, and

</p>
<p>16. <i>Edwards</i>, Vassel, over 80. His father and mother had been slaves in the same district, one
at Retirement, where he himself had lived all his life and was now deacon in the Scotch
Presbyterian church.
</p>
<p class="infoRef">See <a href="#ch134">134</a> and the first two witticisms.
</p>
<p>17. <i>Falconer</i>, Simeon, aged 47. He was an intelligent and resourceful man, a church member but
nevertheless a frequenter of wakes, where he learned his stories. He dictated his
stories to me at his home, without audience, and on various visits. His little sitting-room
held a mahogany table set against the wall, at each end two mahogany chairs, in which
we sat, and a curiously carved chair which a friend had brought him from Africa.

<p class="infoRef">See <a href="#ch146">146</a>.
</p>
<p>19. <i>Forbes</i>, William, over 75. He came from Dry River and was one of my best story-tellers. He
had been song-leader and “Tea-meeting chairman” for his district and was much respected
for his intelligence and sense of order. He came at several different times and sang
or told stories with equal ease and with a freshness and delight which was contagious,
never failing to bring a small gift from his garden and never arguing over the pay.
He had a very long-shaped head and beaming eyes.

different visits to his house.

after work at Moneague and he stood in the middle of the group and acted out the story

speech and gesture. Afterward he recited it to me more slowly, possibly more in detail.

<p>37. <i>Parkes</i>, George, over 40. This blind man had lived in different parts of the island and been
over-seas in Africa. He had picked up stories wherever he went, and he took great
pleasure in reciting them to me. He gave me fifteen at different visits, all very
full and accurate. He was an indifferent singer and made no attempt to act out the
story.

<p>38. <i>Pottinger</i>, Henry, over 70. We were gathered one evening in his son’s cottage near Claremont
for story-telling when the old man made his <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>appearance chanting a nonsense line as he came. It seemed to be a kind of formal prelude
to the occasion, but I could not get the words.
